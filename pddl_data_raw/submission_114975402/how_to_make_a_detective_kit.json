Try a duffel bag, laundry sack, or even a purse or briefcase. Make sure your bag has pockets. A detective needs to be able to grab their tools quickly, without rummaging around. Your bag should have pockets, compartments, or some other way of organizing your things. If you can\u2019t get a bag with pockets, try putting your things into smaller bags, like makeup or sandwich bags. Then, you can put the small bags into the larger one. Choose some backup bags for special missions. If you\u2019re undercover as a hula dancer in Hawaii, carrying a briefcase will ruin your disguise! It\u2019s a good idea to have a few extra bags as backup for undercover work. Try adding a beach bag, a purse, or even a paper grocery bag to your kit.",

Sunglasses or hats are a good way to hide your true identity when you\u2019re on the job. Pick two or three aliases. Every good detective has a few disguises they use over and over again. Choose two or three to be your regular aliases. They should all be different from each other. For example, try having a football player disguise, a grandma disguise, and an artist disguise.[5] If you\u2019re having trouble thinking of good disguises, use people you know as inspiration. Find supplies for each disguise. Each of your disguises should have at least three parts, so make sure you have enough supplies for each of your characters to have a full costume! The first part is something that goes on your head or over your face to hide your identity--wigs, sunglasses, or fake mustaches are a great choice. Each of your aliases should have their own costume. For an old man disguise, try suspenders and high pants. If you want to go incognito as a firefighter, get a yellow raincoat and black boots. Finally, your disguises will all need accessories.

You may need to hop into your disguise at a moment\u2019s notice. You can\u2019t be rummaging around in your bag or putting on the wrong disguise! Each disguise should have its own pocket in your bag. If your bag doesn\u2019t have enough pockets, keep each disguise in its own freezer or grocery bag.",

                "step_contents": " Select a food item to throw. There are a couple of qualifications. First, it must be long, thin, hard, and straight, like a frozen hot dog, for example. Second, it must be a reasonably stiff item. Third, it should be somewhere between 15 and 20 cm (6-8 inches) long; the experiment can be performed otherwise, but read on, and you will see why this size is optimal. There are lots of other items that fit these criteria including Otter Pops, celery, and churros. (If you simply can't come to grips with throwing perfectly good food, see the Tips section for some additional ideas.)\nMeasure the length of your projectile. A tape measure should do the trick. Be as accurate as you can, even down to the millimeter, for best results. Since length is a factor, it\u2019s best to choose food items that are all the same size. If you\u2019ve chosen something that isn\u2019t naturally uniform, such as celery sticks, cut them evenly beforehand. \n Lay down masking tape in parallel strips across the floor as far apart as your projectile is long. The strips should be perpendicular to the direction you will be throwing. If your item is 15-45 cm (6-18 inches) long, lay down about 6-10 strips; lay down fewer if longer and more if shorter.[1]\n On a piece of paper, make a column for \u201cTosses\u201d and another column for \"Crosses.\" The \"Tosses\" column is where you\u2019ll keep track of how many times you throw your food item. The \"Crosses\" column is where you\u2019ll keep track of how many times your item lands across one of the lines. (Note that landing is not the same thing as bouncing.)[2]",

Place one end against the trunk of a tree, high enough that you can fit under it, and the other end against the ground.[8] Check around the tree and look in any cracks with a flashlight, if you have one, to make sure there are no snakes, large spiders, or other animals.\nPlace shorter sticks and branches against the sides of the center pole. Line the length of the middle stick with branches going outward towards the ground at a 45-degree angle. The more sticks you can find to place along the sides, the easier it will be to cover your shelter.[9] You can tie the sticks to the center pole and to each other where they meet in the middle with pieces of vine to make a more stable shelter.\nCover the sides with leaves and foliage to cover the lean-to shelter. Find large leaves and lay them over top of the frame you built. Cover the shelter as well as you can to protect you from the elements and keep animals out.[10] Make sure to build a shelter each night before it gets dark and always sleep at night to rest.",

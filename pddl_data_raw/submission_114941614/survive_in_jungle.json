It can be contaminated with many types of bacteria from animals that will make you very sick. Always avoid drinking water from stagnant pools as the water is likely contaminated.  Make a solar water still with a container and a plastic sheet. Dig a hole in an area that receives at least some direct sunlight and put a container, such as a water bottle or can, in the middle of the hole. Fill the space between the sides of the hole and the container with wet leaves. Place a plastic sheet over the top of the hole and put rocks or other heavy objects around the edges to hold it in place. Put a small stone in the middle of the sheet above the container.[4] The plastic sheet will accumulate condensation that will drip down the underside of the sheet and into the container. This water is distilled and safe to drink. You can use natural containers such as bamboo or a coconut shell if you don\u2019t have a bottle or can. A solar still does not collect large amounts of water. It should be used as a supplemental source of water rather than a primary source\n Look for fruits and plants that you recognize and are safe to eat. Jungles are full of tropical fruits and edible plants if you know what to look for. Don\u2019t try eating any plants that you don\u2019t recognize because they could be poisonous.[5] Look for common jungle fruits you have eaten before such as bananas, pineapples, oranges, passion fruit, coconuts, mangos, and avocados. Bamboo and palms are also safe to eat and commonly found in jungles. Almost all types of palm trees have an edible \"heart\" that you can harvest from the inside of the tree. You can eat bamboo shoots, in other words bamboo that is just starting to grow, but you should boil them before eating them as they are quite tough.  Find a long, straight stick and lean it against a tree to create a lean-to. Make sure the stick is long enough that you will fit under it to sleep. Place one end against the trunk of a tree, high enough that you can fit under it, and the other end against the ground.[8] Check around the tree and look in any cracks with a flashlight, if you have one, to make sure there are no snakes, large spiders, or other animals. 2 Place shorter sticks and branches against the sides of the center pole. Line the length of the middle stick with branches going outward towards the ground at a 45-degree angle.

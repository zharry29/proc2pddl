Go inland and try to find a water source from a stream or waterfall on the island. If it's completely barren, then you'll need to create a solar still and take advantage of rainfall when it occurs. A solar still uses the sun to create condensation. Dig a hole in the ground and put a container at the bottom. Surround the hole with wet leaves, then put a large piece of plastic down over the hole and weigh it down. Condensation will collect in your container and you'll be able to drink it. When it rains, make sure that you are filling up containers to catch the fresh water to keep you hydrated for the long run. Boil the water before you drink it. Check for water at the base of leaves or cacti, inside of caves, hollowed trees, or undercut banks.[1] You can also get water from coconuts, cacti, or other plants and fruits.[2] Collect rainwater in buckets, plastic containers, bins, or garbage cans. Heating the water above 185\u00b0 F (85\u00b0 C) for three minutes will kill all pathogens in your water.[3] Severe dehydration could cause low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, delirium, or unconsciousness.[4] Do not drink salt water from the ocean because it will dehydrate you.[5]",

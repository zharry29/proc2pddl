- summarize action: This action involves melting solid candle wax using a double boiler method. The solid wax is placed in a heat-proof container, which is then placed in a pot filled with water. The pot is heated, and the wax is stirred until it melts completely.
- what is needed to do the action: The action requires solid wax, a heat-proof container, a pot, water, and a heat source.
- what is the result: The solid wax is melted into liquid wax.

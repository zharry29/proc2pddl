If a nuclear attack does happen, it won't be safe to venture outside for food \u2014 you should stay sheltered for at least 48 hours, preferably longer. Having food and medical supplies on-hand can put your mind at-ease, and allow you to focus on other aspects of survival. Stock up on non-perishable food. Non-perishables can last several years, whether it's in storage or in sustaining you after an attack. Choose items that contain a lot of carbohydrates, so you get more caloric bang for your buck, and store them in a cool, dry place. Stock up on medical supplies. Having a few medical items available could be the difference between life and death if you're injured in the attack.\n\n",

Under no circumstances leave the shelter in the first forty-eight hours.[11] The reason for this is to avoid the \"fission products\" created by a nuclear blast. The most deadly of these is radioactive iodine. Fortunately, radio-iodine has a relatively short half-life of eight days (the time it takes for half to naturally decay into safer isotopes). Keep in mind that even after 8-9 days, there will still be a lot of radio-iodine around so limit your exposure. It may take up to 90 days for the amount of radio-iodine to decay to 0.1% of the initial amount. The other major products of nuclear fission are Cesium and Strontium. These have longer half lives of 30 years and 28 years respectively. They also are very well absorbed by living things and can make food products dangerous for decades. These materials can be carried by the wind thousands of miles, so if think you are safe in a remote area, you are not.",

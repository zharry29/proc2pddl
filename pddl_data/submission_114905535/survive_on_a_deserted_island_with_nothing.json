Dehydration can kill a person very quickly, sometimes in as little as three days. For this reason, it's important that you quickly locate water that is safe to drink. Keep some of these ideas in mind while locating drinking water on the island:[9] [10]      Streams or rivers will usually have fresh water in them. Keep in mind that although there is no salt in this water, it may still contain parasites or diseases.     It's always a good idea to boil water you plan on drinking.     Do not drink salt water. Salt water will only cause further dehydration and health issues.     If there is no water available, you may need to build a water still.     You can drink rain or dew that has collected in leaves.     If you find plants, there is a good chance that water is nearby. Try looking ahead for a pool of water or digging down into the ground to find the source of water.     Some thicker vines can be cut open to reveal water. Most water carrying vines will look thick and wooden. Cut a vine open and examine the water. If it looks milky or discolored, don't drink it.     Many foods contain water. If you find something like a coconut or fruit, you can enjoy the meal and get some hydration.",

All you will need is some natural material and a fire-starting technique. There are many techniques that you can use to actually start the fire. As an example, take a look at these steps to get an idea of how you can start a fire without tools:[12] [13] [14]      Find small pieces of wood, tinder, dry leaves or twigs and arrange them in a small tepee.     Having good tinder is important. Try using dry grass, pine resin, birch tree bark or any other dry material that will easily take a flame.     Locate a length of soft wood. Ideally this will have a small groove in it already. However, you could also make a grove by cutting the wood with a sharp stone.     Find a hardwood stick and gather your tinder together.     Put the tinder in the groove. Rub the hardwood stick up and down the groove quickly to create friction.     Eventually the tinder will ignite. Place this tinder in your small kindling tepee to start the fire.     Add larger pieces of wood to build the fire higher.",

Try looking for bananas or coconuts to eat.\nYou can usually eat seaweed if you find it growing nearby. Make sure you find it growing in the island shallows or tidal pools. Seaweed that has drifted to the island may be dangerous to eat.\nYou should cook any food that you find to reduce the chances of eating a parasite or contracting a disease.\nIf you aren't sure if something is poisonous, start by rubbing the food on your hand. If you don't get a rash or reaction, try rubbing it on your lips. If you don't notice anything, try holding it in your mouth for a few minutes before removing it. If you don't feel ill, you can try to eat it.\nCheck out this guide to learn more about testing potentially poisonous plants.",

Tree fires or flares arranged in a triangle is also recognized internationally as a distress signal.     Piling large rocks on the beach can be effective. Try to spell out S.O.S. or HELP with them.     You can also spell messages by drawing in the sand or using large sticks to spell the message out.

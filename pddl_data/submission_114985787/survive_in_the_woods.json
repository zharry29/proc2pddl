Search for a dry, flat area between 2 trees with splits in their trunks.\u00a0Look around the area to find a relatively flat area with a tree that has a trunk that splits about 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52\u00a0m) off of the ground. If possible, try to find 2 trees that have a split in their trunks about 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52\u00a0m) off of the ground and are about 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) apart from each other.  2. Find a branch 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) long and 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2\u00a0cm) thick.\u00a0To form your shelter you need a support beam, so look for a sturdy tree branch that isn't rotting. The straighter the branch, the better it will be for forming the structure of your shelter. Clear off any critters or spiders that may be on the branch. 3. Insert 1 end of the branch into the split of 1 of the trees.\u00a0Where the tree splits and forms a \u201cV\u201d shape, place 1 end of the branch to hold it up as a support beam. If the tree doesn't have a split, use a log that ends in a \u201cV\u201d shape and lean it against a tree so the branch is supported by the tree. 5. Lean branches against the main branch to form the structure of your shelter.\u00a0Gather a bunch of branches that are long enough to be propped up against the main branch of your shelter. Think about forming ribs with the branches. Try to keep them as close together as you can.  6. Lay twigs and leaves over the branches to form a layer of insulation.\u00a0Once you've formed the structure of your shelter, use smaller, leafy branches, brush, or leaves to create a layer of insulation that will help retain heat and provide cover from the wind and rain. Lay the leaves and small branches over the frame in order of decreasing size to create a thick layer.  7. Use leaves to make a bed inside of the shelter.\u00a0Try to make your shelter as comfortable as you can by finding soft material like leaves or pine needles and laying them on the ground inside of your shelter. Check for any insects or spiders on the material before you put it in your shelter.",

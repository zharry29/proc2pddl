Put foliage and leaves over the top of your sticks and you've built a makeshift tent. If you're able to find a tarp or piece of plastic or cloth, then you can also construct a desert tarp. Drive four stakes in a square shape into the sand. Tie your tarp in place and then tie another tarp on top of it, leaving around 2 inches of distance between them. To ensure that the stakes stay in the ground, you can tie the top of them to logs, trees, or rocks in order to anchor them.[17] There are other shelters that you can construct from logs and leaves. Whatever you do, make sure that it protects you from the sun's rays. Salvaged plastic tarps are more efficient at keeping the elements out of your shelter.\n",

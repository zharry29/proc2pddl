Here are the pddl actions based on your request:

- action name: gather_info
- summarize action: The player reads books to gather information on how to create a secret society.
- what is needed to do the action: A player who has not yet done the respective reading.
- what is the result: The player has done the respective reading.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: Not having done the respective reading
    - after: Done the respective reading

pddl:
```
(:action gather_info
  :parameters (?p - player)
  :precondition (not (has_info ?p))
  :effect (has_info ?p)
)

- action name: create_secret
- summarize action: Create secret for a secret society.

pddl:
```
(:action create_secret
  :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (not (has_secret ?sc))
  :effect (has_secret ?sc)
)
```

Repeat this process for the rest of the actions. For instance, the next few actions might look like this:

```
(:action set_meeting_location
  :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (not (has_location ?sc))
  :effect (has_location ?sc)
)

(:action set_dress_code
  :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (not (has_dress_code ?sc))
  :effect (has_dress_code ?sc)
)

(:action create_name
  :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (not (has_name ?sc))
  :effect (has_name ?sc)
)
```

This process can be continued for the remaining actions. Remember that the specificity of precondition and effect definitions may vary depending on the details provided in the narrative or other sources of contextual information.
Okay, let's continue:

- action name: secret_society_is_ready

- what is the result: Society passes the readiness checks.

- entities:
  - entity name: secret_society
    - before: Society hasn't met prerequisites
    - after: Society is ready

pddl:
```pddl
(:action secret_society_is_ready
  :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (and (has_info ?sc) (has_secret ?sc) (has_name ?sc) (has_location ?sc) (has_dress_code ?sc))
  :effect (society_is_ready ?sc)
)
```

pddl:
```pddl
(:action initiate_new_member
  :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (and (society_is_ready ?sc) (not (in ?p ?sc)))
  :effect (in ?p ?sc)
)
```

- action name: teach_new_member_secret

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: Does not know the society's secret
    - after: Knows the society's secret

```pddl
(:action teach_new_member_secret
  :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (and (is_trusted ?p) (not (knows_secret ?p ?sc)))
  :effect (knows_secret ?p ?sc)
)
```

The same process applies for the remaining actions.
Sure, let's continue with the remaining actions:

- action name: remove_member
- summarize action: Remove an existing society member due to untrustworthiness.
- what is needed to do the action: A player who is a part of a secret society and is untrustworthy.
- what is the result: The player is no longer part of the secret society.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: Member of the secret society
    - after: Not a member of the secret society

pddl:
```pddl
(:action remove_member
  :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (and (in ?p ?sc) (not (is_trusted ?p ?sc)))
  :effect (not (in ?p ?sc))
)
```

- action name: check_if_cult
- summarize action: Check if the group is large enough to be a cult.
- what is needed to do the action: A secret society that is not yet identified as a cult.
- what is the result: The secret society is identified as a cult.

- entities:
  - entity name: secret_society
    - before: Not identified as a cult
    - after: Identified as a cult

pddl:
```pddl
(:action check_if_cult
  :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (not (is_cult ?sc))
  :effect (is_cult ?sc)
)
```

Remember that these definitions might need some modification or more specific details in preconditions and effects according to the actual game rules or scenario-specific constraints. For instance, the `check_if_cult` action might require a numerical comparison between the number of members and a certain threshold to decide if a society becomes a cult, but according to the text provided, I made a simple action representation.

I believe we've covered all the actions you provided, but I noticed there are predicates you defined but didn't ask to create PDDL actions for. 

One of them is "equals". If you wanted an action that allows comparing two players you might have:

- action name: compare_players
- summarize action: In this action, two players are compared to each other.
- what is needed to do the action: Two players
- what is the result: The result is a boolean indicating if the two players are equal or not.

- entities:
  - entity name: player1, player2
    - before: two distinct entities
    - after: remains unchanged

pddl:
(:action compare_players
  :parameters (?p1 - player ?p2 - player)
  :precondition (true)
  :effect (equals ?p1 ?p2)
)

Another is "friends". If you wanted to model the action of two players becoming friends, you might have:

- action name: make_friends
- summarize action: This action marks two players as friends with each other.
- what is needed to do the action: Two players
- what is the result: Two players are marked as friends.

- entities:
  - entity name: player1, player2
    - before: not marked as friends
    - after: marked as friends

pddl:
(:action make_friends
  :parameters (?p1 - player ?p2 - player)
  :precondition (not (equals ?p1 ?p2))
  :effect (friends ?p1 ?p2)
)
Given the predicates, actions and requirements you provided, the remaining predicate that we did not use yet is "is_trusted". 

We can consider an action where a member of the society earns trust through some measure, perhaps a task or a test:

- action name: earn_trust
- summarize action: This action marks the player as trusted inside their secret society.
- what is needed to do the action: A member of the society.
- what is the result: The member is now considered trusted.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: not trusted in society
    - after: trusted in society

pddl:
(:action earn_trust
  :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (in ?p ?sc)
  :effect (is_trusted ?p ?sc)
)

Also, there might be a situation where a member loses trust due to some reason:

- action name: lose_trust
- summarize action: This action marks the player as not trusted within the secret society.
- what is needed to do the action: A trusted member of the society.
- what is the result: The member is no longer considered trusted.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: trusted in the society
    - after: not trusted in the society

pddl:
(:action lose_trust
  :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (is_trusted ?p ?sc)
  :effect (not (is_trusted ?p ?sc))
)

These actions assume that "is_trusted ?p - player ?sc - secret_society" means the player ?p is trusted in secret society ?sc. If is_trusted was meant to be used differently, please let me know to adjust the presented PDDL actions accordingly.
Given the remaining predicates, there is no defining action left for them, as we have covered all the given actions in the previous responses. 

However, there can be additional actions based on the gameplay and further context, and these can be defined using the remaining predicates and existing entities. If you provide more details about the gameplay or additional actions, that would assist in defining further corresponding PDDL actions. 

For example, with a little bit of assumption and interpretation, one could create an action for testing players' loyalty or trustworthiness within the secret society:

- action name: test_loyalty
- summarize action: This action represents an event or task that tests a member's loyalty. Based on the results, they're either marked as trusted or not.
- what is needed to do the action: A member belonging to a secret society to be tested.
- what is the result: Based on the loyalty test, the member is either marked as trusted or not trusted in the society.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: trust level status is not defined
    - after: trust level is either marked as trusted or not trusted

PDDL:
(This would actually require two actions: one to grant trust, one to remove it. For brevity, here is the one to grant trust. The removal of trust would be similar to action lose_trust outlined in the previous answers.)

(:action test_loyalty_grant
  :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
  :precondition (in ?p ?sc)
  :effect (when (test_passed ?p) (is_trusted ?p ?sc))
)

(Note that the predicate test_passed isn't initially defined. If a model for testing loyalty was important to your use-case, you would need to define what means a test is passed or failed.)
Given your original set of actions, predicates, and types, it seems that we have covered all the necessary PDDL actions and their related entities based on your text. 

However, we can further elaborate on some aspects of your text if you wish. These could include how the player acquires the necessary info to create a secret society, how the player comes to trust or not trust another member, how the society transitions from being a society to a cult, etc. 

Again, the additional details would aid in providing further PDDL actions and determining states of the entities involved. 

As already mentioned, if there's a change in the status of the secret society from not a cult to a cult, there could be a series of actions leading to this, which need to be defined based on the context or gameplay. Similarly, other additional entities and their states could be identified, which could affect the PDDL translations directly.

For instance, with regard to a player's trust status, we might need to know more about what actions or conditions might lead a player to be trusted or not trusted. This will help create more detailed and nuanced actions and conditions in PDDL.

Let us know if you have more detailed scenarios or conditions specific to your text that you would like to be translated to PDDL.

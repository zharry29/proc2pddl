All right, here we go. This is quite a large-set of actions. I'll provide the pddl for each action. Before starting, I want to note that you might need more predicates to correctly model all the actions, especially those that requires more details.

1. Action: go
The player navigates to an adjacent location.
Condition: none
Effect: change of player location

pddl action:
```
(:action go
    :parameters (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and 
        (at ?player ?loc1) 
        (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)
        (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
    :effect (and 
        (not (at ?player ?loc1)) 
        (at ?player ?loc2)))
```
2. Action: understand
The player understands some concept.
Condition: Player learned the concept.
Effect: no change

pddl action:
```
(:action understand
 :parameters (?p - player ?c - concept)
 :precondition (know ?p ?c)
 :effect (know ?p ?c))
```
3. Action: learn
The learning a skill that can be used to perform other actions in the domain.
Condition: none
Effect: player acquired the skill

pddl action:
```
(:action learn
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - skill)
 :precondition ()
 :effect (learned ?p ?s))
```

For time-saving, I'll just summarize the others.

4. Action: get
Player gets an item.
Effect: the item is in the player's inventory

5. Action: machine_secured, onward to step2
This action would require more details. It seems to be connected with some sequence of actions that should happen before it.

6. Action: enumeration
Player enumerates details about system.
Effect: player has collected all information necessary for hacking (could be different depending on the context)

7. Action: got_all_info
Player has gathered all necessary details.
Condition: All information was collected (enumerated).
Effect: none 

8. Action: ping
Player pings a server to check its availability. 
Effect: ping_succeed

9. Action: check_email_server
Player checks the email server for vulnerabilities.
Effect: server_checked

The remaining actions usually follow a similar pattern: the precondition is that the previous step in the hacking process has been completed and the effect is that the current step has been completed. The final action effect would be that the player becomes a root user without the administrator knowing. Keep in mind to correctly sequence these actions in the plan to adhere to ethical norms and legal considerations.
10. Action: reached_the_remote_system
Player reaches the remote system for further action.
Effect: reached_target_system

11. Action: run_port_scan
Player runs a port scan on the target system.
Effect: port_scanned

12. Action: found_path_in_system
Player identifies accessible path in the target system.
Effect: path_in_system_found

13. Action: contact_and_trick_a_user
Player manages to trick a user for information.
Effect: user_tricked

14. Action: crack_password_by_social_engineering

19. Action: crack_password_by_brute_force
Brute force applied to crack password.
Effect: password_cracked

20. Action: gain_access_with_password
Access gained with the cracked password.
Effect: system_access_gained

21. Action: create_buffer_overflow

Effect: buffer_overflow_created

22. Action: take_control_of_system
Complete control is taken over the system.
Effect: system_control_taken

23. Action: install_malware
Malware is installed into the system.
Effect: malware_installed

24. Action: bypass_standard_authentication_system
Standard authentication system is bypassed.
Effect: auth_system_bypassed

25. Action: not_let_administrator_know
Player prevents the administrator from knowing about the breach.
Effect: breach_concealed

26. Action: make_no_change_to_website
Website is kept unchanged to keep compromise undetected.
Effect: website_unchanged

27. Action: create_fewest_file
Player tries to leave as few traces as possible.
Effect: few_files_created

28. Action: delete_additional_users

Effect: password_hardcoded

30. Action: track_covered
Tracks are covered to avoid leaving behind evidence.
Effect: tracks_covered

I omitted actions learn_concepts, learn_internet, learn_programming, learn_unix, and become_skilled since they are similar to learn action.

For the exact PDDL format, it depends on your problem domain specifics and all the available predicates. This PDDL is somewhat generic, it would need adjustment for an exact problem.
Following the format of each action previously discussed, you might get PDDL like:

10. Action: reached_the_remote_system
```

 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system)
 :precondition (at ?p ?s)
 :effect (reached_target_system ?p))
 ```
11. Action: run_port_scan
```
(:action run_port_scan
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system ?tool - network_scanner)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?s) (has ?p ?tool))
 :effect (port_scanned ?p ?tool))
 ```
12. Action: found_path_in_system
```
(:action found_path_in_system

```
Remember to tailor the actions to your specific problem domain and adjust the parameters, preconditions, and effects accordingly based on what's available in your system.
Continuing with the next set of actions:

21. Action: create_buffer_overflow
```
(:action create_buffer_overflow
 :parameters (?p - player)
 :precondition (learned ?p assembly)
 :effect (created_buffer_overflow ?p))
```
22. Action: take_control_of_system
```
(:action take_control_of_system
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system)
 :precondition (and (authorized ?p ?s) (created_buffer_overflow ?p))
 :effect (is_root_user ?p ?s))
 ```
23. Action: install_malware
```
(:action install_malware
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system ?m - malware)
 :precondition (is_root_user ?p ?s)
 :effect (installed ?p ?m ?s))
```
24. Action: bypass_standard_authentication_system

 :effect (not_detected ?p))
```
26. Action: make_no_change_to_website
```
(:action make_no_change_to_website
 :parameters (?p - player ?w - website)
 :precondition (and (bypassed_auth ?p ?s) (is ?p ?w))
 :effect (unchanged ?w))
```
27. Action: create_fewest_file
```
(:action create_fewest_file

 :effect (few_files_created ?p))
```
28. Action: delete_additional_users
```
(:action delete_additional_users

30. Action: track_covered
```
(:action track_covered
 :parameters (?p - player)
 :precondition (is_root_user ?p ?s)
 :effect (tracks_covered ?p ?s))
```
Again, these are generic and you may need to adjust the conditions and/or effects depending on the specifics of your domain.
Finally, the remaining actions regarding learning, they follow the same pattern as previous.

31. Action: learn_concepts
```
(:action learn_concepts
 :parameters (?p - player ?c - concept)
 :precondition ()
 :effect (learned ?p ?c))
```
32. Action: learn_internet
```
(:action learn_internet
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - skill)
 :precondition ()
 :effect (know_internet ?p))
 ```
33. Action: learn_programming
```
(:action learn_programming
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - skill)
 :precondition ()
 :effect (know_programming ?p))
```
34. Action: learn_unix
```
(:action learn_unix
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - skill)
 :precondition ()
 :effect (know_unix ?p))
```
35. Action: become_skilled
```
(:action become_skilled
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - skill)
 :precondition ()
 :effect (learned ?p ?s))
```
Remember to thoroughly review the produced PDDL code, cross-check it with specified predicates, make necessary adjustments, enhancements or corrections based on the specifics of your domain and the intended behaviour of your AI model. You might need to add or remove preconditions or effects of given actions to fit your model better. It's always good to start with clear and well-designated actions and predicates in your PDDL then build upon them gradually.
Your PDDL models seem to be set up well, and you asked to continue, but you've already described all of your actions. If you need more assistance on particular points:

- If you want help refining your `learn` actions, these are pretty standard "acquisition" actions in PDDL. You might add a `(not (learned ?p ?s))` precondition before learning each concept, to make it clear in plans that concepts cannot be re-learned.

- You could refine the future actions that depend on the `learn` actions. For example, an action that requires a certain skill could include `(learned ?p ?s))` in its preconditions, to make sure the skill s has been learned by the player p before the action can be performed.

- Your `concept` type seems to be treated a lot like `skill`. If these are different in a way that affects whether or how they can be learned or their effects on post-learning actions, you might want to separate `learn_concepts` and `learn_skills` into two separate actions.

- If you have more actions or concepts to describe and need help turning those into PDDL, please provide information on those new actions or concepts.

- If you're looking to design an entire PDDL problem or domain file and need help putting all of these elements together with objects and initial and goal states, I can help guide you through that as well.

Let me know how you want to proceed, and I'll do my best to assist you!
As you've asked to continue, here are some potential further development points for your actions. 

They involve setting up more precondition, effect and parameter specifics which accounts for certain features of the task. For example, if hacking, the concept of 'time' is crucial and some tasks might take longer than others.

Let's look at a couple of examples:

36. Action: install_backdoor
``` 
(:durative-action install_backdoor
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system ?t - tool)
 :duration (= ?duration (use_time ?t))
 :condition (and 
     (over all (is_root_user ?p ?s)) 
     (over all (know ?p hacking))
     (over all (has ?p ?t)))
 :effect (has_backdoor ?s))
```
In this example, the 'duration' field is introduced. It assumes you have an '(use_time ?t)' predicate that defines how long it takes to use each 'tool', which in this case might be different scripts. 

The 'condition' field in this example uses 'over all', which means that condition must hold throughout the entire duration of the action. 

37. Action: man_in_the_middle_attack
```
(:action man_in_the_middle_attack
 :parameters (?p - player ?m1 - mobile_phone ?m2 - mobile_phone ?i - item)
 :precondition (and 
     (connected_wifi ?m1 ?i) (connected_wifi ?m2 ?i) 
     (learned ?p hacking)) 
 :effect (and 
     (intercepted_data ?p ?m1 ?m2) 
     (not (know ?m1 intercepted)) 
     (not (know ?m2 intercepted))))
```
In this case, the player interjects into the communication of two mobile phones. The action requires that both mobile phones are connected to the same wifi (item) and that the player has learned hacking. The effect is that the player intercepts their data, but the mobile phones are not aware this happen. 

Remember, in PDDL the action only happens if all conditions are met and then all effects occur. Adjust and use these examples according to your specific case!
Sure! Continuing on with more advanced actions:

38. Action: apply_patch

Represents the act of the player applying a security patch to a digital system. This might be used to prevent the system from being further exploited.

```
(:action apply_patch
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system ?pa - patch)
 :precondition (and 
     (is_root_user ?p ?s) 
     (inventory ?p ?pa)
     (applicable ?pa ?s)) 
 :effect (patched ?s ?pa))
```
A new 'patch' type is introduced for different security patches that can be applied to the system. The effect predicate 'patched' may have been exploited earlier and can no longer be used for access.

39. Action: remove_malware

Player removes malware from a digital system. 

```
(:action remove_malware
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system ?m - malware)
 :precondition (and 
     (is_root_user ?p ?s) 
     (installed ?m ?s)) 
 :effect (not (installed ?m ?s)))
```
The removal of the malware from the system might be a clean-up move, signaling that the player is already trying to move away from the system.

40. Action: wipe_logs

The player wipes logs to erase their activity traces on a system.
```
(:action wipe_logs
 :parameters (?p - player ?s - digital_system)
 :precondition (is_root_user ?p ?s) 
 :effect (and 
     (logs_wiped ?s) 
     (not (tracks_covered ?p ?s))))
```
The 'effect' may lead onto additional actions where the admin could notice missing logs and apply countermeasures.

Remember that these actions are a step towards modelling complex tasks and interactions of different elements in your environment. The specifics and how rich your actions and predicates are will greatly impact your model's ability to derive meaningful and realistic plans.

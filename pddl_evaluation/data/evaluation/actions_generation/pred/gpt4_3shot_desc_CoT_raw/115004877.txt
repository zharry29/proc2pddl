I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems all the actions you requested: `get`, `poke`, `flip`, `wrap`, `hit`, `free` and `remove_fiber` have been defined in PDDL from your provided text, based on the requirements, types and predicates you've specified.

If you have more actions to analyze and translate to PDDL or if you need help with something else related to this topic, kindly provide more details so I can assist you better.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but without specific actions to define or translate into PDDL, or additional requirements, types, predicates, it's hard to provide the information you're looking for.

The seven actions you provided -- `get`, `poke`, `flip`, `wrap`, `hit`, `free`, and `remove_fiber` -- have all been defined. If you have new actions to be analyzed and to be translated into PDDL stanza, or if you need revisions on the existing ones, please provide those details. Otherwise, If you have other queries related to planning domain definition language or any other topic, I would be more than happy to assist!
I apologize for any confusion, but could you specify what information or actions you need next? So far, I've converted your seven actions (`get`, `poke`, `flip`, `wrap`, `hit`, `free`, and `remove_fiber`) into the PDDL format based on the provided predicates, types, and requirements.

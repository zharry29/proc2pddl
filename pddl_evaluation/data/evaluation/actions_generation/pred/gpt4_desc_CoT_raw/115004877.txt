Now, all actions for making papyrus have been translated into PDDL format. Ensure all relevant predicates are included in the 'parameters', 'precondition', and 'effect' fields. Remember to update the provided predicates to accurately reflect the entities and changes in each action. Follow this process for any similar tasks in the future.

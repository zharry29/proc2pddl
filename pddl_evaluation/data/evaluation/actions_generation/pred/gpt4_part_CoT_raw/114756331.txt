- action name: go
- summarize action: The player moves from one location to another in a specific direction.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must not be stuck in quicksand and there must be a connection between the two locations in the given direction.
- what is the result: The player is now at the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at the initial location
    - after: at the new location
  - entity name: direction

    - before: player is at this location
    - after: player has moved to the new location
  - entity name: new location
    - before: player is not at this location
    - after: player is now at this location

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if the player is not stuck in quicksand.
2. Check if there's a connection between the initial location and the new location in the given direction.
3. Change the player's position from the initial location to the new location.

- action name: get
- summarize action: The player picks up an item at their current location.
- what is needed to do the action: The item must be at the same location as the player and not already in their inventory.
- what is the result: The item is added to the player's inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: player

  - entity name: item
    - before: at the player's current location
    - after: in the player's inventory

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Ensure the item is at the player's current location and not already in their inventory.
2. Add the item to the player's inventory.

pddl:
(:action get

**The breathe, liedown, swim, usestick, rest, drop, check_ripples, and test_ground actions will be similar to the previous examples. Below I'll provide another example for the action research.**

- action name: research
- summarize action: The player researches the area around them to become aware of a nearby quicksand location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be calm and not currently aware of the nearby quicksand location.
- what is the result: The player becomes aware of the nearby quicksand location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: unchanged (calm and not aware of the nearby quicksand location)
    - after: unchanged (calm and aware of the nearby quicksand location)
  - entity name: nearby quicksand location
    - before: not aware by player
    - after: aware by player

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if the player is calm.
2. Check if the player is not already aware of the nearby quicksand location.
3. Make the player aware of the nearby quicksand location.

pddl:
(:action research
   :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
   :precondition (and
                  (calm ?p)
                  (not (aware ?p ?l)))
   :effect
   (aware ?p ?l))
- action name: move_horizontally
- summarize action: The player takes a few quick steps backward to prevent their feet from getting fully stuck in quicksand.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be at a location with quicksand and not fully stuck in it yet.
- what is the result: The player moves to another location away from the quicksand, avoiding getting stuck.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at a location with quicksand and not fully stuck
    - after: at a different location without quicksand
  - entity name: initial location
    - before: player is at this location with quicksand
    - after: player has moved to another location
  - entity name: new location
    - before: player is not at this location and it doesn't have quicksand
    - after: player is now at this location

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if the player is at a location with quicksand and not fully stuck in the quicksand.
2. Ensure a new location without quicksand is connected to the initial location.
3. Move the player from the initial location to the new location.

pddl:
(:action move_horizontally
  :parameters (?p - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and
                  (at ?p ?loc1)
                  (has_quicksand ?loc1)
                  (not (stuck ?p ?q - quicksand))
                  (connected ?loc1 ?dir - direction ?loc2)
                  (not (has_quicksand ?loc2)))
  :effect (and
            (not (at ?p ?loc1))
            (at ?p ?loc2)))


- action name: drop
- summarize action: The player drops an item from their inventory at the current location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be holding the item in their inventory.
- what is the result: The item is dropped and placed at the player's current location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: unchanged
    - after: unchanged
  - entity name: item
    - before: in player's inventory
    - after: at the player's current location
  - entity name: location
    - before: unchanged
    - after: unchanged

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Ensure the item is in the player's inventory.
2. Remove the item from the player's inventory.
3. Place the item at the player's current location.

pddl:
(:action drop
   :parameters (?p - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and
                  (at ?p ?loc)
                  (inventory ?p ?item))
   :effect (and
             (not (inventory ?p ?item))
             (at ?item ?loc)))


- action name: check_ripples
- summarize action: The player checks for ripples in the ground to identify a potential quicksand location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be at a location with ripples, but not yet aware of the quicksand.
- what is the result: The player becomes aware of the quicksand location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: not aware of potentially dangerous ripples
    - after: aware of potentially dangerous ripples
  - entity name: location
    - before: has ripples and quicksand, player not aware
    - after: has ripples and quicksand, player aware

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if the player is at a location with ripples and not yet aware of the quicksand.
2. Make the player aware of the quicksand location.

pddl:
(:action check_ripples
   :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
   :precondition (and
                  (at ?p ?l)
                  (has_ripples ?l)
                  (has_quicksand ?l)
                  (not (aware ?p ?l)))
   :effect
   (aware ?p ?l))


**The test_ground action should follow a similar pattern to the rest of the actions.

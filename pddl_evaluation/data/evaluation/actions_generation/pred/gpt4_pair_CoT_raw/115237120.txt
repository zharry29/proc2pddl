- action name: go
- summarize action: The player moves from one location to another in the specified direction.
- what is needed to do the action: There must be a connection between the current location and the target location in the specified direction. The connection must not be blocked.

    - after: player not at the location
  - entity name: target location
    - before: player not at the location
    - after: player at the location

- convert the above information to PDDL using relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if there is a connection between the current location and the target location in the specified direction: (connected ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
2. Check if the connection is not blocked: (not (blocked ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location))
3. Move the player from the current location to the target location: (at ?player - player ?loc2 - location)

PDDL:
```
(:action go

These are just some examples of how to implement actions in PDDL format. You may have more actions based on your specific scenario. It is important to keep track of entities and their transformations to accurately create the corresponding PDDL predicate and action structure.

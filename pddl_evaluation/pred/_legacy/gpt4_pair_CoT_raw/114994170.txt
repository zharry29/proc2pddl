States before the action:
- The item is at a location.
- The player is at the same location.

States after the action:
- The player has the item in the inventory.

PDDL format:
```
(:action get
   :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
   :effect (and
        (inventory ?player ?item)
        (not (at ?item ?loc))))
```

   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?item) (at ?player ?loc))
   :effect (and
        (at ?item ?loc)
        (not (inventory ?player ?item))))
```

Action-text pair 3: Put_in_stopper

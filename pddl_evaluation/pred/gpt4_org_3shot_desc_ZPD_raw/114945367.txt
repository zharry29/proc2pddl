I can help you translate the actions into PDDL based on the provided predicates, types and requirements.

Action 1:
- action name: go
- summarize action: The player navigates to an adjacent location.
- what is needed to do the action: The direction to the adjacent location and the locations should be connected.
- what is the result: The player moves to the adjacent location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: the player is at the initial location 
    - after: the player is at the adjacent location

pddl action:
(:action go
 :parameters (?p - player ?dir - direction ?from - location ?to - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?from) (connected ?from ?dir ?to))
 :effect (and (not (at ?p ?from)) (at ?p ?to))
)

Action 2:
- action name: get
- summarize action: The player picks up an item and puts it in their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The item must be at the player's location.
- what is the result: The item is now in the player's inventory and no longer at the current location.

- entities:
  - entity name: item 
    - before: the item is at a certain location 
    - after: the item is no longer at the location
  - entity name: player 
    - before: the player does not have the item in the inventory 
    - after: the player has the item in their inventory

pddl action:
(:action get
 :parameters (?p - player ?i - item ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?i ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?i ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?i))
)

And additional actions would follow the same pattern. Notice that some predicates and types are not used in these first two actions but will be used in the following examples:
- strain_water where the player strains the water with a cloth to eliminate solid particles.
- boil_water where the player boils the water with a container to purify it.
- get_long_branch, get_propped_branches, get_twigs_leaves to gather necessary items for building a shelter.
- build_shelter would change the predicate has_shelter to true for specific player etc.
Sure, here are a few more actions translated into PDDL format.

Action 3:
- action name: get_water
- summarize action: The player obtains water from a water source.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be at a location that has a water source.

    - before: the water is at the location 
    - after: the water is no longer at the location

    - after: the player has the water in their inventory

pddl action:
(:action get_water
 :parameters (?p - player ?w - water ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_water_source ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?w ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?w))
)

Action 4:
- action name: strain_water
- summarize action: The player strains water using cloth to eliminate solid particles.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must have both water and cloth in the inventory.
- what is the result: The water in the player's inventory becomes strained.

    - after: the player has strained water in their inventory

pddl action:
(:action strain_water
 :parameters (?p - player ?w - water ?c - cloth)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?w) (inventory ?p ?c) (not (strained ?w)))
 :effect (strained ?w)
)

Action 5:
- action name: boil_water

(:action boil_water
 :parameters (?p - player ?w - water ?container - container)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?w) (inventory ?p ?container) (strained ?w))
 :effect (treated ?w)

    - after: the player has treated water in their inventory

pddl action:
(:action purify_in_sunlight
 :parameters (?p - player ?w - water)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?w) (not (treated ?w)))
 :effect (treated ?w)
)

 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_branches ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?b ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?b))
)
 
And so on... You would continue this pattern for the remaining actions: get_propped_branches, get_twigs_leaves, build_shelter, get_logs, get_dry_materials, build_teepee, and start_fire.
Sure, let us continue with rest of the actions.

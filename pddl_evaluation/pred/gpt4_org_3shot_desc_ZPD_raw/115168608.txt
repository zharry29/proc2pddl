Then we can define the following actions in the Problem Domain Description Language (PDDL):

For the action of `get`:

- action name: get
- summarize action: This action involves the player picking up an item and putting it in their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: A player and an item that exists in the location they're currently at.
- what's the result: The item is moved from the location to the player's inventory.
- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: not possessing the item
    - after: possesses the item
  - entity name: item
    - before: located at a location
    - after: located in player's inventory

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?location - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?item ?location) (not (not_gettable ?item)))
  :effect (and (inventory ?player ?item) (not (at ?item ?location)))
)
```

...

Moving to `cut_sheet` action:

- action name: cut_sheet
- summarize action: This action includes cutting the finished papyrus sheet to size.
- what is needed to do the action: A player, a knife, and finished papyrus strips.
- what is the result: The papyrus is created from the finished papyrus strips.
- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: possessing knife and finished strips
    - after: possessing knife and papyrus
  - entity name: finished strips
    - before: present in player's inventory
    - after: absent in player's inventory
  - entity name: papyrus
    - before: not present in player's inventory
    - after: present in player's inventory

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action cut_sheet
  :parameters (?player - player ?knife - knife ?finished_strips - finished_strips ?papyrus - papyrus)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?knife) (inventory ?player ?finished_strips))
  :effect (and (inventory ?player ?papyrus) (not (inventory ?player ?finished_strips)))
)
```

Please note that if you have additional predicates which reflect the different states of items (e.g., `(cuttable ?item)`), they would need to be reflected in the preconditions of the corresponding actions (e.g., the `cut_papyrus` action could require `(cuttable ?papyrus)`).

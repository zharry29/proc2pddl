Here is the translation of the provided actions into correct PDDL format:

- action name: go
- summarize action: Navigate from one location to another adjacent location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, the current location, the destination, and a connection between the locations.
- what is the result: The player moves from the current location to the destination.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at current location
    - after: at destination
  - entity name: location (current)
    - before: contains player
    - after: does not contain player
  - entity name: location (destination)
    - before: does not contain player
    - after: contains player

pddl action:
(:action go
 :parameters (?player ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
 :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)))


Similarly, you can translate other actions. But let's take one more action as an example to provide further assistance.

- action name: cut_plant
- summarize action: Cut a plant to obtain a stalk
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a plant, and a tool (e.g., scissors)
- what is the result: The plant is cut and the player obtains a stalk

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: having scissors
    - after: having scissors and a stalk
  - entity name: plant
    - before: uncut
    - after: cut
  - entity name: stalk
    - before: does not exist
    - after: exists

pddl action:
(:action cut_plant
 :parameters (?player ?plant ?tool)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?tool ?loc) (at ?plant ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?plant ?loc)) (at ?stalk ?loc)))

In a similar fashion, you can create PDDL actions for all other actions.
Please remember PDDL is a language for describing planning problems, thus you need to adapt your problem properly into it. The use of parameters, precondition, and effect will depend on how your problem can be expressed within this framing. You might want to add, modify, or delete predicates according to make the actions fits well in planning, which might diverge from the natural language description.
Sure, here are translations for the next three actions:

- action name: peel_stalk
- summarize action: Peel the outer layer of a stalk.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a stalk.
- what is the result: The stalk is peeled and ready to be processed further.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: stalk
    - before: unpeeled
    - after: peeled

pddl action:
(:action peel_stalk
 :parameters (?player ?stalk)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?stalk) (not (peeled ?stalk)))
 :effect (peeled ?stalk))


- action name: cut_stalk_into_strips
- summarize action: Cut a peeled stalk into thin strips.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a peeled stalk, and scissors.
- what is the result: The stalk is cut into thin strips.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: has peeled stalk and scissors
    - after: has strips and scissors
  - entity name: stalk
    - before: intact
    - after: cut into strips

pddl action:
(:action cut_stalk_into_strips
 :parameters (?player ?stalk ?scissors)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?stalk) (inventory ?player ?scissors) (peeled ?stalk))
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?stalk)) (inventory ?player ?strips)))


- action name: soak_strips
- summarize action: Soak the cut strips in water.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, strips, water.
- what is the result: The strips are soaked and clean.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: strips
    - before: unsoaked
    - after: soaked and clean

pddl action:
(:action soak_strips
 :parameters (?player ?strips ?loc)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?strips) (has_water ?loc) (at ?player ?loc) (not (clean ?strips)))
 :effect (clean ?strips))

For the remaining actions, the process would be the same: summarize the action, figure out which entities interact during this action, determine how these entities change, and finally translate this information into the PDDL format.
Sure, let's continue with the subsequent actions:

- action name: dry_out_strips
- summarize action: Drying out the soaked strips after cleaning.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, clean strips.
- what is the result: The strips are dry.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: strips
    - before: soaked and clean
    - after: dry

pddl action:
(:action dry_out_strips
 :parameters (?player ?strips)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?strips) (clean ?strips))
 :effect (dry ?strips))

- action name: weave_strips_into_sheet
- summarize action: Weaving the dry strips into a rough sheet.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, dry strips.
- what is the result: A roughly woven sheet is created.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: has dry strips
    - after: has sheet
  - entity name: strips
    - before: separate
    - after: woven into a sheet

pddl action:
(:action weave_strips_into_sheet
 :parameters (?player ?strips)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?strips) (dry ?strips))
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?strips)) (inventory ?player ?sheet)))

- action name: press_sheet
- summarize action: Pressing the rough sheet to flatten it.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a rough sheet, a hard surface.
- what is the result: The sheet is flat.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: has rough sheet
    - after: has flat sheet
  - entity name: sheet
    - before: rough
    - after: flat

pddl action:
(:action press_sheet
 :parameters (?player ?sheet ?loc)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?sheet) (has_hard_surface ?loc) (at ?player ?loc))
 :effect (flat ?sheet))

Continuing in this fashion, you can construct the remaining PDDL actions.
Sure! Let's continue with the subsequent actions:

- action name: flatten_sheet
- summarize action: Further flatten the pressed sheet for a smoother texture.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a flat sheet, and a hard surface.
- what is the result: The sheet is very flat.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
     - unchanged
  - entity name: sheet
     - before: flat
     - after: very flat

pddl action:
(:action flatten_sheet
 :parameters (?player ?sheet ?loc)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?sheet) (has_hard_surface ?loc) (at ?player ?loc) (flat ?sheet))
 :effect (very_flat ?sheet))

- action name: polish_sheet
- summarize action: Polish the very flat sheet to make it smooth.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a very flat sheet.
- what is the result: The sheet is smooth.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
     - unchanged
  - entity name: sheet
     - before: very flat
     - after: smooth

pddl action:
(:action polish_sheet
 :parameters (?player ?sheet)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?sheet) (very_flat ?sheet))
 :effect (smooth ?sheet))

- action name: cut_sheet
- summarize action: Cut the smooth sheet into the shape of a papyrus.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, a smooth sheet, and scissors.
- what is the result: A papyrus is created.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
     - before: has smooth sheet
     - after: has papyrus
  - entity name: sheet
     - before: smooth
     - after: cut into the shape of a papyrus

pddl action:
(:action cut_sheet
 :parameters (?player ?sheet ?scissors)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?sheet) (inventory ?player ?scissors) (smooth ?sheet))
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?sheet)) (inventory ?player ?papyrus)))

In practice, you might want to define the papyrus as a different item type to distinguish it from the generic "sheet".

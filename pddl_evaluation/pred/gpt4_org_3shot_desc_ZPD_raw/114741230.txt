Sure, let's translate them into PDDL actions. And I will also add the reader and location parameters and types as they were used but not previously defined.

PDDL types:
```pddl
(:types
    player secret_society reader location
)
```

PDDL Actions:

1. Gather Info

```pddl
(:action gather_info
    :parameters (?p - player ?r - reader)
    :precondition (and)
    :effect (has_info ?p)
)
```

2. Create Secret

```pddl
(:action create_secret
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and)
   :effect (has_secret ?sc)
)
```

3. Set Meeting Location

```pddl
(:action set_meeting_location
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society ?l - location)
   :precondition (and)
   :effect (has_location ?sc)
)
```

4. Set Dress Code

```pddl
(:action set_dress_code
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and)
   :effect (has_dress_code ?sc)
)
```

5. Create Name

```pddl
(:action create_name
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and)
   :effect (has_name ?sc)
)
```

6. Secret Society is Ready

```pddl
(:action secret_society_is_ready
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and (has_name ?sc) (has_secret ?sc) (has_location ?sc) (has_dress_code ?sc))
   :effect (society_is_ready ?sc)
)
```

7. Initiate New Member

```pddl
(:action initiate_new_member
   :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (society_is_ready ?sc)
   :effect (in ?p ?sc)
)
```

8. Teach New Member Secret

```pddl
(:action teach_new_member_secret
   :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and (in ?p ?sc) (is_trusted ?p ?sc))
   :effect (knows_secret ?p ?sc)
)
```

9. Remove Member

```pddl
(:action remove_member
   :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and (in ?p ?sc) (not (is_trusted ?p ?sc)))
   :effect (not (in ?p ?sc))
)
```

10. Check if Cult

```pddl
(:action check_if_cult
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (and (society_is_ready ?sc) (not (is_cult ?sc)))
   :effect (is_cult ?sc)
)
```
Please update the precondition for the `check_if_cult` action to reflect the criteria for being a cult in your domain (e.g., minimum number of members). Additionally, if the `equals` and `friends` predicates are important for your domain, you may need to add related actions to handle these aspects (e.g., `make_friends`, `identify_same_player`).

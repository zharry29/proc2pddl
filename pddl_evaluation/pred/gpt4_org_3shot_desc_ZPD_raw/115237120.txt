For each action, I will infer from the text what we need to perform each action, their effects, and changes in entity states.

Action: go
- summarize action: The player moves from one location to another in a specific direction.
- what is needed to do the action: The player is able to move, and the two locations are connected in that direction.
- what is the result: The player's location changes.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at current location
    - after: at new location
  - entity name: location
    - before: without player 
    - after: with player

pddl action:
(:action go
  :parameters (?player - player ?start - location ?dir - direction ?end - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?start) (connected ?start ?dir ?end) (not (blocked ?start ?dir ?end))) 
  :effect (and (not (at ?player ?start)) (at ?player ?end))
)

  - entity name: player
    - before: without item in inventory
    - after: with item in inventory
  - entity name: item
    - before: at location
    - after: in player's inventory

pddl action:
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - gettable ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc)) 
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)

Action: drop
- summarize action: The player drops an item from their inventory to current location.

  - entity name: item
    - before: in player's inventory
    - after: at player's location

pddl action:
(:action drop
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?item)) 
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?item)) (at ?item ?loc))
)

Follow this pattern for the rest of your actions. Substitute proper preconditions and effects keeping in mind the effects of each action on the world state. The entities involved are mostly the player, the items, and the location(s).
Sure, let's continue with the rest of your actions.

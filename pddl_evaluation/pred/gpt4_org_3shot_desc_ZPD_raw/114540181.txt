pddl action:
(:action go
 :parameters (?player - player ?start - location ?dir - direction ?dest - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?start) (connected ?start ?dir ?dest) (not (blocked ?start ?dir ?dest)))
 :effect (and (not (at ?player ?start)) (at ?player ?dest))
)

- action name: get

pddl action:

 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)

You can follow the same pattern for remaining actions using the text to PDDL translation method demonstrated above. Each action should have all appropriate parameters defined, clear and complete precondition and effect clauses, and include all related entities.
- action name: get_bamboo_container

pddl action:

(:action collect_rain_water
 :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_rainfall ?loc) (inventory ?player bamboo_container))
 :effect (inventory ?player water))
 
Note: You might want to add a water predicate in the player's inventory to track water presence as you did for bamboo_container.

Follow the similar approach for remaining actions. Each of them should have clearly defined parameters, precondition and effects. Make sure all involved entities are covered.

 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player stone)) (not (inventory ?player wood)) (inventory ?player fire))
)

Please note that you may need to adjust the actions based on your exact requirements, for instance, tracking treated and untreated water separately in the inventory. Continue similarly for other actions.

You can follow the same pattern for remaining actions. Remember that each action needs to have all relevant parameters defined, clear & complete precondition and effect clauses, and must include all related entities.

)

Again, remember that each action must have all the relevant parameters adequately identified, clear and complete precondition and effect clauses, and involve all related entities.

pddl action:

 :parameters (?player - player)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player fruit) (is hungry ?player)) 
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player fruit)) (not (is hungry ?player)))
)

Remember to always identify all key parameters involved in an action and accurately define precondition and effect while including all related entities.

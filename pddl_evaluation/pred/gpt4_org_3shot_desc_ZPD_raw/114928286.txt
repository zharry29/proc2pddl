First, I would need the complete context or text referring these actions in order to summarize them, identify the entities and their states during the action, and then form the pddl actions.

Let's take the case of one of the actions you've listed as an example to illustrate the process:

**Action to summarize:** 

`go`: Navigate to an adjacent location.

**Requirements for the action:** 

A player, a starting location, a destination location, and a navigable path (not blocked) connecting the two locations.

**Result of the action:** 

The player moves from the starting location to the destination location.

**Entities involved in the action:** 

  - entity name: player
    - before: at the starting location
    - after: at the destination location
  - entity name: starting location
    - before: player is present
    - after: player is not present
  - entity name: destination location
    - before: player is not present
    - after: player is present

**PDDL action:**
```
(:action go
 :parameters (?player - player ?start - location ?end - location ?dir - direction)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?start) (connected ?start ?dir ?end) (not (blocked ?start ?dir ?end)))
 :effect (and (not (at ?player ?start)) (at ?player ?end)))
 ```

Certainly, I can only provide accurate translations for the other actions if I have a detailed understanding of what these actions entail, given in the form of a descriptive text. Some of these actions involve seemingly complex movements (like 'throw') or cognitive tasks ('be_amazed') which might require more nuanced translations into PDDL format.
Let's continue to the next action:

**Action to summarize:**

`get`: Pick up an item and put it in the inventory.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player, an item available at the player's location, and the capacity in the player's inventory to store the item.

**Result of the action:**

The item is moved from the location to the player's inventory.

**Entities involved in the action:**

  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: item
    - before: at the player's location
    - after: in the player's inventory
  - entity name: location
    - before: contains the item
    - after: does not contain the item
  - entity name: inventory
    - before: does not contain the item
    - after: contains the item

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action get
 :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc) (is_gettable ?item))
 :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

Note: This PDDL action assumes that there's no limit to the player's inventory. If there is, you may include another precondition to check whether the inventory is full, and another predicate to keep track of inventory capacity.
Sure, let's continue to the next action:

**Action to Summarize:**

`lay_masking_tape`: Lay masking-tape on a given object.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player, an object on which masking-tape can be laid, and masking tape available in the player's inventory.

**Result of the action:**

The masking-tape is moved from the player's inventory onto the object.

**Entities involved in the action:**

  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: object
    - before: does not have masking tape
    - after: has masking tape
  - entity name: masking_tape
    - before: in the player's inventory
    - after: on the object

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action lay_masking_tape
 :parameters (?player - player ?masking_tape - masking_tape ?object - object)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?masking_tape) (is_long ?object) (is_straight ?object) (is_hard ?object) (is_stiff ?object))
 :effect (and (has_ten_strips ?object ?masking_tape) (not (inventory ?player ?masking_tape))))
```

Again, this PDDL action assumes that there's no limit to how much masking-tape can be laid on an object. If there is, you may include another precondition to check whether the object is already covered with sufficient masking-tape, and another predicate to keep track of the amount of masking-tape on each object.
Let's continue with the next action:

**Action to Summarize:**

`make_tosses_column`: Make a column labelled 'tosses' on a piece of paper.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player, a piece of paper, and a pen (or other writing instrument).

**Result of the action:**

The piece of paper has a column labelled 'tosses'.

**Entities involved in the action:**

  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: paper
    - before: does not have a 'tosses' column
    - after: has a 'tosses' column

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action make_tosses_column
 :parameters (?player - player ?paper - paper ?pen - pen)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?pen) (at ?player ?loc) (at ?paper ?loc))
 :effect (tosses_column ?paper))
```

Next, let's look at `make_crosses_column`, which will have a very similar structure to `make_tosses_column`. 

**Action to Summarize:**

`make_crosses_column`: Make a column labelled 'crosses' on a piece of paper.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player, a piece of paper, and a pen (or other writing instrument).

**Result of the action:**

The piece of paper has a column labelled 'crosses'.

**Entities involved in the action:**

  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: paper
    - before: does not have a 'crosses' column
    - after: has a 'crosses' column

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action make_crosses_column
 :parameters (?player - player ?paper - paper ?pen - pen)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?pen) (at ?player ?loc) (at ?paper ?loc))
 :effect (crosses_column ?paper))
```
Okay, let's move forward with the action `thaw_food`.

**Action to Summarize:**

`thaw_food`: Thaw frozen food items.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player and frozen food items in the inventory or at the location of the player.

**Result of the action:**

The frozen food items become thawed.

**Entities involved in the action:**

- entity name: player
  - unchanged
- entity name: food_item
  - before: frozen
  - after: thawed

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action thaw_food
  :parameters (?player - player ?food_item - food_item)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?food_item) (frozen ?food_item))
  :effect (not (frozen ?food_item)))
```

We'll follow with the `throw` action.

**Action to Summarize:** 

`throw`: Throw food items at a given location.

**Requirements for the action:** 

A player, thawed food items in the player's inventory, and a particular location to throw the items.

**Result of the action:** 

The food items from the player's inventory had been thrown at the given location.

**Entities involved in the action:**

  - entity name: player
    - unchanged
  - entity name: food_item
    - before: in the player's inventory
    - after: at the desired location
  - entity name: location
    - before: without the food items
    - after: with the thrown food items 

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action throw
 :parameters (?player - player ?food_item - food_item ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?food_item) (not (frozen ?food_item)) (at ?player ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?food_item)) (thrown_food_items ?loc)))
```

Note: The `throw` action assumes the player can only throw food items that are in their inventory and not frozen. If the player can throw frozen food items too, you could modify the precondition accordingly.
Next, let's go to the `record_tosses` action.

**Action to Summarize:**

`record_tosses`: Record the number of tosses on a piece of paper.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player, a pen, and a piece of paper where a 'tosses' column has been created.

**Entities involved in the action:**

- entity name: player
  - unchanged
- entity name: paper
  - before: 'tosses' column is empty
  - after: 'tosses' column has records

**PDDL action:**
```
 (:action record_tosses

  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?pen) (at ?player ?loc) (at ?paper ?loc) (tosses_column ?paper))
  :effect (tosses_recorded ?paper))
```
Next is `record_crosses`.

**Action to Summarize:**

`record_crosses`: Record the number of successful throws (crosses) on a piece of paper.

**Requirements for the action:**

  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?pen) (at ?player ?loc) (at ?paper ?loc) (crosses_column ?paper))
  :effect (crosses_recorded ?paper))
```

Let's continue to the next action:

**Action to Summarize:**

`divide_crosses`: Divide the number of successful throws (crosses) by a given number.

**Requirements for the action:**

A player, a pen, and a piece of paper where the number of crosses has been recorded.

 :parameters (?player - player ?paper - paper)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?paper ?loc) (tosses_recorded ?paper) (crosses_divided ?paper))
 :effect (calculated_pi ?player))
```
The last action to translate to PDDL is `be_amazed`.

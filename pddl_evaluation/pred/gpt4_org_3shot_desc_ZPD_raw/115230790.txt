pddl action:
(:action listen_to_astronomers_predictions
  :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
  :precondition (and (has_pc ?p) (at ?p ?l))
  :effect (listen_to_broadcast ?p ?l)
)

Please note: For the remaining actions, they could be performed in a similar manner by creating a summarize action of what happens when that action is performed, then list what is needed to carry out that action, then the results. Afterwards, identify all entities involved before and after the action, then translate it into PDDL format.

I will provide the translation to PDDL format for all actions.

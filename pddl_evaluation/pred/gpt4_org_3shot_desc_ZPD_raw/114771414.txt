Sure, here is the translation of your actions into pddl format:

- action name: go
- summarize action: This action is for navigating the player from one location to another location which is connected by direction.
- what is needed to do the action: The action requires a player, two locations, and one direction.
- what is the result: The player is at the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: at the original location 
    - after: at the new location
  - entity name: location
    - before: not includes the player
    - after: includes the player

pddl action:
```
(:action go
    :parameters (?player ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
    :precondition (and 
                    (at ?player ?loc1)
                    (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)
                    (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
    :effect (and 
              (not (at ?player ?loc1))
              (at ?player ?loc2)))
```

For brevity, I will provide PDDL actions for the remaining actions without the preceding natural language steps:

```
(:action get
    :parameters (?player ?item ?loc)
    :precondition (and 
                    (at ?player ?loc)
                    (at ?item ?loc))
    :effect (and 
              (not (at ?item ?loc))
              (inventory ?player ?item)))

(:action get_water
    :parameters (?player ?water ?loc)
    :precondition (and 
                    (at ?player ?loc)
                    (has_water_source ?loc)
                    (at ?water ?loc))
    :effect (and 
              (not (at ?water ?loc))
              (inventory ?player ?water)))

    :effect (edible ?animal))

    :effect (and 
              (not (at ?stick ?loc))
              (inventory ?player ?stick)))

                    (at ?player ?loc)
                    (at ?tarp ?loc))
    :effect (and 
              (not (at ?tarp ?loc))
              (inventory ?player ?tarp)))

(:action get_leave
    :parameters (?player ?leave ?loc)
    :precondition (and 
                    (at ?player ?loc)

    :effect (and 
              (not (at ?leave ?loc))
              (inventory ?player ?leave)))

(:action construct_shelter
    :parameters (?player ?loc)
    :precondition (or 
                    (and (inventory ?player ?tarp)
                         (inventory ?player ?stick))
                    (and (inventory ?player ?leave)
                         (inventory ?player ?stick)))
    :effect (sheltered ?loc))

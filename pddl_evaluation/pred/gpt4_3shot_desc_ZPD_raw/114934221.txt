Please note that the predicates and effects used in the actions will depend on your game world characteristics and the specific function of each action within the game. The way I have shown above is quite abstract and generalized. Depending on your game world, you may want to define more specific predicates and effects. For example, if splashing may draw the attention of the shark, you may want to add a predicate to capture this scenario and reflect it in your action definition.

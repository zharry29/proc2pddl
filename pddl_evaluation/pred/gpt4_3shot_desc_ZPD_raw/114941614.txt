Sure, I'll help you fill out the actions of your PDDL domain based on the provided entity actions and predicates.

Here is the frame for the actions you gave:

- action name: go
  - summarize action: This describes the player navigating to an adjacent location.
  - what is needed to do the action: An adjacent location that is unblocked.
  - what is the result: The player moves to the new location.
  - entities:
    - entity name: player
      - before: at location1
      - after: at location2
  pddl action:
```
(:action go
 :parameters (?p - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
 :effect (and (not (at ?p ?loc1)) (at ?p ?loc2)))
```
.. and here's the rest in loose format for brevity:

- get: Pick up an item, it disappears from location and appears in inventory
```
(:action get
 :parameters (?p - player ?i - item ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?i ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?i ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?i)))
```
- collect_water: Get water from a water source location, water appears in container
```
(:action collect_water
 :parameters (?p - player ?container - container ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_water_source ?loc) (inventory ?p ?container))
 :effect (and (contains ?container water) (is_full ?container)))
```
- gather_sticks: Get sticks from the ground, they appear in inventory
```
(:action gather_sticks
 :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_sticks ?loc))
 :effect (inventory ?p sticks))
```
the rest are:
- make_fire
- boil_water
- cook_food
- eat_poisoned_food
- eat_contaminated_food
- eat_food
- drink_contaminated_water
- drink_water
- build_shelter
- sleep_in_shelter

I see your requirements and types are correctly defined. As for you predicates, it's a well-designed list considering your range of actions and trying to simulate a survival environment. Some of them heavily relate to 'player states', which reflects a realistic simulation clearly. Well done!
Great, hereâ€™s the rest.

                     (is_full ?container)

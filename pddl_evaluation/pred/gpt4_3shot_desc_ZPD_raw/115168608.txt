Based on your provided text and requirements, here's the translation into PDDL format:

- action name: get
- summarize action: The action represents the process of picking up an item to put it in the inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: A player and the item.
- what is the result: The item is in the player's inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: not holding the item
    - after: holding the item
  - entity name: item 
    - before: not in the player's inventory
    - after: in the player's inventory

pddl action:
```
(:action get
 :parameters (?player - player ?item - item)
 :precondition (at ?item ?player)
 :effect (inventory ?player ?item)
)
```

- action name: travel
- summarize action: The action represents the process of travel from one location to another.
- what is needed to do the action: Initial location and final location.
- what is the result: The player is at the final location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: at the initial location
    - after: at the final location

pddl action:

)
```

The remaining actions maintain the same logic involving specific entities (papyrus plant, stalks, strips, etc.) and their respective transformations (cut, soaked, dried, woven, finished). Each action will have its own preconditions and effects that alter the state of the provided entities according to the action's specifics. It's crucial to follow the PDDL syntax and parameters for each specific action when describing these operations.

    - before: not holding the papyrus plant
    - after: holding the papyrus plant

)
```

The remaining actions would follow the same structure, with the process involved outlined in the 'summarize action', the entities required detailed under 'what is needed to do the action', and the final state of the entities outlined under 'what is the result'. The corresponding PDDL code then follows in the 'pddl action' section.
- action name: cut_strips

```

- action name: soak_strips
- summarize action: This action is about soaking papyrus strips in the water.

```

The remaining actions have similar conversion processes from natural language into PDDL format, by identifying the preconditions, and how the entities are expected to change upon the completion of the action.

 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?strips) (dried ?strips)) 
 :effect (woven ?strips)
)
```

The actions of "bundle_strips" and "cut_sheet" have a similar conversion process from natural language into PDDL format, by identifying the preconditions, parameters, and effects (how the entities are expected to change) upon the completion of the action.
- action name: bundle_strips
- summarize action: This action is about bundling the woven papyrus strips between sheets of linen and wooden boards.
- what is needed to do the action: Player, woven papyrus strips, linen sheets, and wooden boards in the inventory.

    - after: used for bundling strips

pddl action:
```

pddl action:
```

 :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?finished_papyrus) (finished ?finished_papyrus) (inventory ?player ?knife)) 
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?finished_papyrus)) (inventory ?player ?final_papyrus))

```
Remember, these PDDL actions are designed to capture the essential parts of the operation, i.e., the entities involved, their initial and final conditions, and the result of the action, while abstracting from the minutiae of 'how' it is accomplished, the 'procedure'. Hence, the actual process of 'how' to cut the papyrus into stalks/strips, or 'how' to roll or weave the strips, etc., are not captured in these PDDL actions. We may need to adjust the actions or extend the domain language to capture such detailed procedures.

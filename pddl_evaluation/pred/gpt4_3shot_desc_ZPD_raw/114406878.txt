Alright, based on your information, I can create the PDDL action translations:

First, we start with 'go' action:
- action name: go
- summarize action: The player navigates to an adjacent location.
- what is needed to do the action: Player and adjacent location.
- what is the result: The player is at a new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: at initial location 
    - after: at the new location

pddl action:
```
(:action go
   :parameters (?player ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) 
                      (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) 
                      (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
   :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) 
                (at ?player ?loc2)))
```

Now, let's model the 'get' action:
- action name: get
- summarize action: The player picks up an item and puts it into their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: Player, item, and the location of the item.
- what is the result: The item is in the player's inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: item 
    - before: at location 
    - after: in player's inventory

pddl action:
```
(:action get
   :parameters (?player ?item ?loc)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
   :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

I can definitely help create all the actions for you in such a way. But, to save some time and effort, I think the rest of the actions will share a similar pattern with these two. You mostly change the parameters and the predicates inside precondition and effect, but the overall structure remains largely the same. Is there any specific action you are not sure how to format?
Moving on, let's tackle the 'get_grass' action:
- action name: get_grass
- summarize action: The player gathers grass that is not dry at the first time.
- what is needed to do the action: Player, grass, and the location of the grass.
- what is the result: The grass is in the player's inventory and it's marked as not dry.

- entities:
  - entity name: grass 
    - before: at location 
    - after: in player's inventory and not dry

pddl action:
```
(:action get_grass
   :parameters (?player ?grass ?loc)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?grass ?loc))
   :effect (and (not (at ?grass ?loc)) 
                (inventory ?player ?grass)
                (not (dry ?grass))))
```

Next, the 'dry_grass' action:
- action name: dry_grass
- summarize action: The player dries the grass to be used as tinder.
- what is needed to do the action: Player and grass in the inventory.
- what is the result: The grass in the player's inventory is dry.

- entities:
  - entity name: grass 
    - before: in player's inventory and not dry 
    - after: in player's inventory and dry 

pddl action:
```
(:action dry_grass
   :parameters (?player ?grass)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?grass) 
                      (not (dry ?grass)))
   :effect (dry ?grass))
```

These are the PDDL actions translated from the text for 'get_grass' and 'dry_grass' actions. If you need more actions, please let me know.
Proceeding with 'cluster_grass' action:

- action name: cluster_grass
- summarize action: The player clusters gathered dry grass to make tinder.
- what is needed to do the action: Player and dry grass in the inventory.
- what is the result: The player has tinder in the inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: grass
    - before: in player's inventory and dry 
    - after: in player's inventory as tinder

pddl action:
```
(:action cluster_grass
   :parameters (?player ?grass)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?grass) 
                      (dry ?grass))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?tinder))
```

Then, for 'break_branch' action:

- action name: break_branch
- summarize action: The player breaks larger branches into smaller pieces.
- what is needed to do the action: Player and large dry branch at the location.
- what is the result: The player has kindling in the inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: branch 
    - before: at location and large 
    - after: in player's inventory as kindling

pddl action:
```
(:action break_branch
   :parameters (?player ?branch ?loc)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) 
                      (at ?branch ?loc)
                      (has_large_dry_branch ?loc))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?kindling))
```

Please note that these actions are simplified versions and the real implementation might also include checks for item count, inventory capacity, tool availability, and so on. Also, some predicates might need to be named more specifically or differently to avoid confusion in larger domains. Let me know if you need further actions defined in PDDL.
Great, let's keep going. 

For the 'log_oak' action:
- action name: log_oak

                      (has_dry_oak ?loc))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?log))

                      (inventory ?player ?fuel))
   :effect (and (inventory ?player ?teepee) 
                (not (inventory ?player ?tinder))
                (not (inventory ?player ?kindling))
                (not (inventory ?player ?fuel))))
```

These actions represent the 'log_oak', 'stack_log' and 'build_teepee' actions. Please, tell me if you need to continue modeling the remaining actions.

These are the PDDL actions translated from the text for 'get_wood', 'get_branch' and 'ignite_wood' actions. If you need more actions, please let me know.

                      (ignited ?wood))
   :effect (and (ignited ?teepee)

   :effect (and (not (at ?water ?loc)) 
                (in ?water ?pot)))
```

These are the PDDL actions translated from the text for 'ignite_teepee', 'get_pot', and 'get_water' actions. If you need more actions, please let me know.
The final action 'boil_water' can be modeled as follows:

   :effect (and (boiled ?water) 
                (not (inventory ?player ?teepee))))
```

This is the PDDL action translated from the text for 'boil_water' action. The above specified actions should cover all your provided cases in surviving in the woods scenario.

Remember, due to interactions in real-world scenarios, your actions might need adjusting and additional conditions. Furthermore, if you have more than one player or are considering taking turns or simultaneous actions, you might require a more complex framework like multi-agent planning or durative actions in PDDL.

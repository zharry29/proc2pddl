- action name: check_if_cult
  - summarize action: Check if the group is large enough for a cult.
  - what is needed to do the action: An Internet and a secret society.
  - what is the result: The secret society is a cult.
  This action is unspecified and needs more elaboration to be translated into a meaningful pddl action.
  However, assuming that there's a fixed number (for example 10) of members required to be recognized as a cult, and keeping track of the member count, we can write the following pddl action:
  ```
  (:action check_if_cult
    :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
    :precondition (>= (count_member ?sc) 10)
    :effect (is_cult ?sc)
  ) 
  ```
Please note, you'll need to define the `count_member` operator (which counts the number of members in a secret society) in your domain. Keep in mind that PDDL doesn't support the counting function or inequality natively, so you might need an extension or workaround depending on the planner you're using. Your available predicates also need to track every society member for this to work.

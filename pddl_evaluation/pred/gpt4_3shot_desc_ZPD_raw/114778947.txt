action name: go
summarize action: The player navigates to an adjacent location
what is needed to do the action: An accessible adjacent location and freedom of movement
what is the result: The player is in a different location

entities:
   - entity name: player 
     - before: at the starting location
     - after: at the adjacent location
   - entity name: location
     - before: might be inaccessible due to an obstacle
     - after: accessible and contains player

pddl action:
(:action go
 :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
 :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)))

etc, for all other actions.

For example:
action name: get
summarize action: The player picks up an item and puts it into their inventory 
what is needed to do the action: An available item at the player's location and enough space in the inventory 
what is the result: The player is in possession of the item

entities:
   - entity name: player 
     - before: does not possess the item
     - after: possesses the item
   - entity name: item
     - before: at the place where the player is
     - after: in the player's inventory 

pddl action:
(:action get
 :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))

Please fill the corresponding pddl actions for all the remaining actions from the text, using the same steps.
Sure, let's continue with the next actions using the same format. 

- action name: pick_lock_with_card
- summarize action: The player uses a card from their inventory to pick an easy lock at their location.
- what is needed to do the action: A card in the player's inventory and an easy lock at the player's location.
- what is the result: The lock at the player's location becomes unblocked.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at a location with an easy lock
    - after: at a location without a blocked direction due to easy lock being picked
  - entity name: card
    - before: in the player's inventory
    - after: unchanged, still in the player's inventory
  - entity name: lock
    - before: locked
    - after: unlocked

pddl action:
(:action pick_lock_with_card
  :parameters (?player - player ?card - item ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?card) (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (has_easy_lock ?loc2))
  :effect (and (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))))

This approach can be used for the remaining actions as well, defining their preconditions and effects based on their action summaries and entity states. Do note that depending on the specifics of the game, more detailed preconditions and effects might be added to these actions.
Of course. I will now generate the PDDL for the remaining actions based on the text and requirements you provided. 

- action name: file_key_into_wrench
- summarize action: The player uses a file to turn an allen key into a wrench.
- what is needed to do the action: A file and an allen key in the player's inventory.
- what is the result: The player's inventory now contains a wrench instead of an allen key.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: Has an allen key and a file in the inventory
    - after: Has a wrench and a file in the inventory
  - entity name: wrench
    - before: Not in the player's inventory
    - after: In the player's inventory
  
pddl action:
(:action file_key_into_wrench
  :parameters (?player - player ?key - item ?file - item)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?file) (inventory ?player ?key)) 
  :effect (and (inventory ?player ?wrench) (not (inventory ?player ?key))))

The same process can be carried out for all other action steps. Depending upon the exact scenario, some actions might have more or less complex action preconditions and results. For instance, if you have a limit to your inventory, you might want to include preconditions for checking if the inventory isn't full before adding items.
Certainly, let's proceed with the next few actions:

- action name: bend_paperclip_into_pick
- summarize action: The player bends a paperclip into a pick.
- what is needed to do the action: A paperclip in the player's inventory.
- what is the result: The player's inventory now contains a pick instead of a paperclip.

    - before: Has a paperclip in the inventory
    - after: Has a pick in the inventory
  - entity name: pick

pddl action:
(:action bend_paperclip_into_pick
  :parameters (?player - player ?clip - item)
  :precondition (inventory ?player ?clip)
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?clip)) (inventory ?player ?pick))) 

- action name: insert_wrench
- summarize action: The player inserts a wrench into a hard lock.
- what is needed to do the action: A wrench in the player's inventory and a hard lock at the player's location.

  :parameters (?player - player ?wrench - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?wrench) (at ?player ?loc) (has_hard_lock ?loc))
  :effect (wrench_in_lock ?loc))

We'll continue this process for the rest of the actions.
Action name: insert_pick
summarize action: The player inserts a lock pick into a lock.
what is needed to do the action: A pick in the player's inventory and a wrench is in the lock at the player's location.
what is the result: The pick is in the lock.

entities:
entity name: player

 :effect (and (not (has_hard_lock ?loc)) (not (wrench_in_lock ?loc)) (not (pick_in_lock ?loc))))

We'd continue with the similar approach for the remaining actions as well.
Continuing with the PDDL formulation for the next set of actions:

- action name: straighten_coathanger
- summarize action: The player straightens a coathanger.
- what is needed to do the action: A coathanger in the player's inventory.
- what is the result: The player's inventory now contains a straightened coathanger instead of a coathanger.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: Has a coathanger in the inventory
    - after: Has a straightened coathanger in the inventory
  - entity name: coathanger
    - before: In the player's inventory
    - after: Straightened in the player's inventory

- pddl action:
(:action straighten_coathanger
  :parameters (?player - player ?hanger - item)
  :precondition (inventory ?player ?hanger)
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?hanger)) (inventory ?player ?straight_hanger)))

- action name: lift_weatherstripping
- summarize action: The player lifts the weatherstripping on a locked car.

    - after: At a location with a locked car with lifted weatherstripping
  - entity name: locked car
    - before: Has weatherstripping
    - after: Has lifted weatherstripping

- pddl action:
(:action lift_weatherstripping
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (locked_car ?loc))
  :effect (weatherstripping_removed ?loc))

We can then repeat the similar steps for the remaining actions.
Continuing with the next actions:

- action name: insert_hanger
- summarize action: The player inserts a straightened coathanger into the car through the lifted weatherstripping.
- what is needed to do the action: A straightened coathanger in the player's inventory and a car with lifted weatherstripping at the player's location.
- what is the result: The coathanger is inserted into the car.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: Has a straightened coathanger in the inventory
    - after: Unchanged
  - entity name: straightened coathanger
    - before: In the player's inventory
    - after: Inserted into the car
  - entity name: car
    - before: Has lifted weatherstripping
    - after: Has a coathanger inserted

pddl action:
(:action insert_hanger
  :parameters (?player - player ?hanger - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?hanger) (at ?player ?loc) (weatherstripping_removed ?loc))
  :effect (coathanger_inserted ?loc))

- action name: hook_latch
- summarize action: The player maneuvers the inserted coathanger to hook onto the car latch.
- what is needed to do the action: A car at the player's location with an inserted coathanger.
- what is the result: The car latch is hooked by the coathanger.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: At location with car with inserted coathanger
    - after: Unchanged 
  - entity name: car
    - before: Has coathanger inserted but latch is not hooked
    - after: Latch is hooked by coathanger

pddl action:
(:action hook_latch
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (coathanger_inserted ?loc))
  :effect (latch_hooked ?loc))

Note that how you make the precondition and effect specifications depends on the finer details of the game's mechanics. Consequently, multiple valid pddl specification versions could exist for any given action. You have to choose one that best fits the mechanics and goals of your game. Keep on going with this process for the remaining actions mentioned in your list.
Continuing with the next action:

- action name: pull_coathanger
- summarize action: The player pulls the coathanger that is hooked onto the car latch.
- what is needed to do the action: A car at the player's location with a coathanger hooked onto the latch.
- what is the result: The car is unlocked.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: At location with car with hooked latch 
    - after: Unchanged 
  - entity name: car
    - before: Locked with latch hooked by the coathanger
    - after: Unlocked

- pddl action:
(:action pull_coathanger
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (latch_hooked ?loc))
  :effect (not (locked_car ?loc)))

Note that the inventory has not been specified in the pull_coathanger action. Depending on the requirements of your game, you may wish to add an effect that removes the coathanger from the player's inventory, or a precondition that ensures the player is holding the coathanger before they can pull it. This will depend on whether the player can do other things while holding the coathanger. 

These are all the actions based on the list you provided. This methodology can easily be adapted to define additional actions for your game scenarios.

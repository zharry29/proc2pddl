Sure, based on your provided predicates, types, and actions, here are the pddl actions orderly with the predicates.

- action name: get
Summarize action: The player picks an item and adds it to inventory.
What is needed to do the action: The player and an item at the same location.
What is the result: The item is in the player's inventory.

entities:
- entity name: player
- before: at the location
- after: at the location with the item in inventory
- entity name: item
- before: at the location
- after: in the player's inventory

pddl action:
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location ?item - item)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
  :effect (inventory ?player ?item)
)
```

The rest of the actions would be followed in a similar manner. Here is a brief of how it could be:

- action name: drop
pddl action:
```
(:action drop
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item)
  :precondition (inventory ?player ?item)
  :effect (not (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```
- action name: put_in_stopper
pddl action:
```
(:action put_in_stopper
  :parameters (?item - item)
  :precondition (and (has_stopper ?item) (not (sealed ?item)))
  :effect (sealed ?item)
)
```
- action name: fill
pddl action:
```
(:action fill
  :parameters (?, ?)
  :precondition (?, ?)
  :effect (?, ?)
)
```
- action name: purify
pddl action:
```
(:action purify
  :parameters (?, ?)
  :precondition (?, ?)
  :effect (?, ?)
)
```
- action name: seal
pddl action:
```
(:action seal
  :parameters (?, ?)
  :precondition (?, ?)
  :effect (?, ?)
)
```
- action name: wait
pddl action:
```
(:action wait
  :parameters (?, ?)
  :precondition (?, ?)
  :effect (?, ?)
)
```
- action name: go
pddl action:
```
(:action go
  :parameters (?, ?)
  :precondition (?, ?)
  :effect (?, ?)
)
```
- action name: put_batteries_in
pddl action:
```
(:action put_batteries_in
  :parameters (?, ?)
  :precondition (?, ?)
  :effect (?, ?)
)
```

and so on...
Kindly note, as I don't have knowledge about precondition and effect of several events, I substituted them with (?, ?). You will need to replace them with your actual predicates to make these actions useful.
Continuing from where we left off:

- action name: turn_on_radio
Summarize action: The player turns on the radio.
What is needed to do the action: A radio with batteries in it.
What is the result: The radio is on.

entities:
- entity name: radio
- before: off
- after: on

pddl action:
```
(:action turn_on_radio
  :parameters (?radio - radio)
  :precondition (has_batteries ?radio)
  :effect (on ?radio)
)
```

- action name: create_cage
Summarize action: The player creates a Faraday cage.
What is needed to do the action: N/A (assumed that all necessary materials are already present).
What is the result: A Faraday cage exists.

entities:
- entity name: Faraday cage
- before: non-existent
- after: existent

pddl action:
```
(:action create_cage
  :parameters (?cage - farraday_cage)
  :effect (exists ?cage)
)
```

Note: "exists" is a custom predicate. Replace it with an appropriate realization in your domain.

- action name: close_cage
Summarize action: The player closes a Faraday cage.
What is needed to do the action: An open Faraday cage.
What is the result: The Faraday cage is closed.

entities:
- entity name: Faraday cage
- before: open
- after: closed

pddl action:
```
(:action close_cage
  :parameters (?cage - farraday_cage)
  :precondition (not (cage_closed ?cage))
  :effect (cage_closed ?cage)
)
```

- action name: put_in_cage
Summarize action: The player puts an item in a Faraday cage.
What is needed to do the action: An item and an open Faraday cage.
What is the result: The item is in the Faraday cage.

entities:
- entity name: item
- before: not in the Faraday cage
- after: in the Faraday cage
- entity name: Faraday cage
- before: open and without the item
- after: open and with the item

pddl action:
```
(:action put_in_cage
  :parameters (?item - item ?cage - farraday_cage)
  :precondition (and (not (cage_closed ?cage)) (not (in_cage ?item)))
  :effect (in_cage ?item)
)
```

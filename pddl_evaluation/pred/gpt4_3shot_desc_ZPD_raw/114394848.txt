I'll provide one example of action translation. Here is the translation for the action "go" based on your provided information:

- action name: go
- summarize action: This action represents the navigation from one digital system location to another adjacent location. The entity involved in this action is the player who is moving between locations.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be authorized, there needs to be a connective path between the current location and the target location, and the path must not be blocked.
- what is the result: The player moves to the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at the original location
    - after: at the new location
  - entity name: original location
    - before: has the player present
    - after: does not have the player present
  - entity name: new location
    - before: does not have the player present
    - after: has the player present

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action go
  :parameters (?player - player ?origin - location ?direction - direction ?destination - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?origin) (connected ?origin ?direction ?destination) (not (blocked ?origin ?direction ?destination)) (authorized ?player))
  :effect (and (not (at ?player ?origin)) (at ?player ?destination))
)
```
Please note that since your project seems to be quite complex, you will probably need to refine the preconditions and effects of each action based on the specific details of your project. The example above is a high-level, general translation of the "go" action based on the information you provided, and it may not cover all the possible nuances of your scenario. For example, you might need to consider whether the player can move in all directions from a given location, or whether there are any conditions that could prevent the player from moving.
Of course, let's proceed with the "learn" action:

- action name: learn
- summarize action: This action represents the player learning a new skill. The main entities involved here are the player and the skill to be learned.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to apply themselves to learn the new skill. The skill cannot be one that the player has already learned.
- what is the result: The player now has the learned skill.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: does not have the skill
    - after: has the skill
  - entity name: skill
    - before: is not learned by the player
    - after: is learned by the player

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action learn
  :parameters (?player - player ?skill - skill)
  :precondition (and (know ?player ?concept) (not (learned ?player ?skill)))
  :effect (learned ?player ?skill)
)
```

Again, this is quite a high-level definition. Depending on the requirements of your project, you may need to add additional parameters, conditions or effects to the action. For example, you might want to add a "time" parameter if the action of learning a skill takes a certain amount of time, or a "resource" parameter if it requires certain resources.
Sure, let's continue with the next action "get":

- action name: get
- summarize action: This action illustrates the action of the player obtaining a specific item. In this action, the entities involved are the player and the item.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at the same location as the item, and the item must not already be in the player's inventory.
- what is the result: The item will be added to the player's inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: does not have the item in inventory
    - after: has the item in inventory
  - entity name: item
    - before: at the same location as the player
    - after: in the player's inventory
  - entity name: location
    - before: has the item
    - after: does not have the item

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc) (not (inventory ?player ?item)))
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```
Once more, you may need to tailor this to meet the specific needs or restrictions of your project. For instance, you could require the item to be visible or reachable by the player, or require the player to have enough space in their inventory to pick up the item.
Let's translate the "machine_secured" action. 

- action name: machine_secured
- summarize action: This action illustrates the action of the player securing a machine. The entities involved are the player and the machine.
- what is needed to do the action: The player has reached the machine and has permissions to secure it.
- what is the result: The machine is secured.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: the player is at the machine but the machine is not secured
    - after: the machine is secured
  - entity name: machine 
    - before: unsecured
    - after: secured

pddl action (inferring from your predicates what will make a machine be secured is the player being there and having permissions):

```pddl
(:action machine_secured
  :parameters (?player - player ?machine - digital_system)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?machine) (authorized ?player))
  :effect (secured ?machine)
)
```

For more complex settings, you may need to include additional parameters or conditions. For example, if securing the machine involves a specific set of tasks like updating the system, installing a particular software, or setting up a firewall, you might want to include conditions checking that these tasks have been done.
Let's proceed with the action called "enumeration":

- action name: enumeration
- summarize action: This action represents the player enumerating or listing out details of the target system. The main entities involved in this action are the player and the target digital system that is being enumerated.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be authorized, be at a location where the digital system can be accessed, and the system must not have been enumerated already.
- what is the result: The system gets enumerated by the player.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at location accessing the system, and system is not enumerated
    - after: enumerates the system
  - entity name: digital system
    - before: not enumerated
    - after: enumerated

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action enumeration
  :parameters (?player - player ?system - digital_system)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (access ?loc ?system) (not (enumerated ?system)) (authorized ?player))
  :effect (enumerated ?system)
)
```

As before, please adjust based on your project requirements which could include additional nuances to this action. For example, if enumeration requires specific tools or skills, you might want to include conditions that check whether the player has these resources.
Let's move onto the "got_all_info" action:

- action name: got_all_info
- summarize action: This action demonstrates the player acquiring all necessary information. The main entities involved are the player and the information to be collected.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to have collected all parts of the necessary information.
- what is the result: The player has obtained all the necessary information.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: does not have all necessary information
    - after: has all necessary information
  - entity name: all_information
    - before: not completely obtained by the player
    - after: completely obtained by the player

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action got_all_info
  :parameters (?player - player ?all_information - all_information)
  :precondition (and (not (collected_all_info ?player ?all_information)))
  :effect (collected_all_info ?player ?all_information)
)
```

Given the high-level context provided, further specifications may need to be included depending on the specific requirements of the project. For example, if there are specific forms or sub-types of information to be collected, those could be refined in the action parameters.
Let's proceed with the translation of the "ping" action:

- action name: ping
- summarize action: This action represents pinging a digital system by the player to test the connectivity. The main entities involved in this action are the player and the digital system.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs authorization, must be at a location where the digital system can be accessed, and the system should not have been pinged successfully before (or within a specified time limit, depending on your settings).
- what is the result: The system gets pinged successfully by the player and the connection to the system is confirmed.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at location from where system can be accessed, but system hasn't been pinged successfully yet (or within a specific time frame)
    - after: pings the system successfully
  - entity name: digital system
    - before: not pinged (successfully)
    - after: pinged (successfully)

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action ping
  :parameters (?player - player ?system - digital_system)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (access ?loc ?system) (not (ping_succeed ?system)) (authorized ?player))
  :effect (ping_succeed ?system)
)
```

This is a high-level definition based on your predicates. Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to include additional preconditions or effects. For instance, you could include a condition that checks whether the player has the necessary tools or skills to perform a network ping.
Sure. Let's define the next action "check_email_server":

- action name: check_email_server
- summarize action: This action represents the player checking an email server. The main entities involved in this action are the player and the email server.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be authorized, be able to access the email server, and the server has not been checked before.
- what is the result: The email server is checked by the player.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: has not checked the email server
    - after: has checked the email server
  - entity name: email server
    - before: unchecked
    - after: checked

pddl action:
```pddl
(:action check_email_server
  :parameters (?player - player ?server - digital_system)
  :precondition (and (access ?player ?server) (not (server_checked ?server)))
  :effect (server_checked ?server)
)
```

Depending on the specific requirements of your project, you may need to include additional preconditions or effects. For example, if checking the email server requires specific tools or conditions, these might be reflected in your predicates and incorporated into the action definition.

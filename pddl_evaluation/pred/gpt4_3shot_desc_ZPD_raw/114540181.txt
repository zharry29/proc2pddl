Based on your provided actions, requirements, types, and predicates, here is a translation into PDDL format. 

First, for the action "go"
- action name: go
- summarize action: The player navigates to an adjacent location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at a location that is connected to another location and the path should not be blocked.
- what is the result: The player moves to the adjacent location.
- entities:

    - before: at location1
    - after: at location2
pddl action:
```
(:action go
    :parameters (?p - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
    :precondition (and 
                    (at ?p ?loc1) 
                    (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)
                    (not(blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
                  )
    :effect (and
                (at ?p ?loc2)
                (not (at ?p ?loc1))
             )
)
```

   :precondition (and 
                    (at ?p ?loc)
                    (at ?i ?loc)
                  )
   :effect (and
                (inventory ?p ?i)
                (not (at ?i ?loc))
            )
)
```

For the action "get_bamboo_container", since the parameters and the effects are not provided, we can't create the PDDL action. Please provide more details about it so we can help you. The same goes for the other actions. If you provide the summarization for each of them, the prerequisites and effects, I can help you generate PDDL actions for them.
Understood, continuing with the next action "get_bamboo_container"

   :precondition (and 
                     (at ?p ?loc) 
                     (has_bamboo ?loc)
                 )
   :effect (and 
                (inventory ?p ?b)
                (not (has_bamboo ?loc))
            )

   :effect (and 
                (inventory ?p ?w)
            )

```

Please note that these are assumptions given the information. You might need to adjust your predicates or actions based your specific needs.
For the action "create_fire":
- action name: create_fire
- summarize action: The player creates a fire using wood and stone from their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to have wood and stone in their inventory.
- what is the result: A fire object is created.
- entities:
  - entity name: fire
    - before: nonexistent
    - after: existent

pddl action:
```
(:action create_fire
   :parameters (?p - player ?wood - wood ?stone - stone ?f - fire)
   :precondition (and 
                     (inventory ?p ?wood)
                     (inventory ?p ?stone)
                 )
   :effect (inventory ?p ?f)
)
```

For the action "treat_water":

    - after: treated

pddl action:
```
(:action treat_water

   :precondition (and 
                     (inventory ?p ?f)
                     (inventory ?p ?w)
                     (not (treated ?w))
                 )
   :effect (treated ?w)
)
```
Please remember, this PDDL formulation is designed with the understanding that the player only has one water source that needs to be treated. If there are multiple sources of water that need differentiating, an individual identifier for each water source would need to be added as a parameter.
For the action "drink_water":

- action name: drink_water
- summarize action: The player drinks treated water.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to have treated water in their inventory and should be dehydrated.
- what is the result: The player is no longer dehydrated, and the treated water is removed from the inventory.
- entities:
  - entity name: water
    - before: in inventory, treated
    - after: consumed by player

pddl action:
```
(:action drink_water
   :parameters (?p - player ?w - water)
   :precondition (and 
                     (inventory ?p ?w) 
                     (treated ?w) 
                     (is dehydrated ?p)
                 )
   :effect (and
             (not(inventory ?p ?w)) 
             (not(is dehydrated ?p))
            )
)
```

For the action "drink_untreated_water":

- action name: drink_untreated_water
- summarize action: The player drinks untreated water.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to have untreated water in their inventory and should be dehydrated.
- what is the result: The player becomes ill, the player is no longer dehydrated, and the untreated water is removed from the inventory.
- entities:
  - entity name: untreated water
    - before: in inventory
    - after: consumed by player

pddl action:
```
(:action drink_untreated_water
   :parameters (?p - player ?w - water)
   :precondition (and 
                     (inventory ?p ?w) 
                     (not(treated ?w)) 
                     (is dehydrated ?p)
                 )
   :effect (and
             (not(inventory ?p ?w)) 
             (not(is dehydrated ?p))
             (is ill ?p)
            )
)
```

For the action "create_sos_sign":

- action name: create_sos_sign
- summarize action: The player creates an SOS sign using wood and stone from their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to have wood and stone in their inventory.
- what is the result: An SOS sign comes into existence.
- entities:
  - entity name: SOS sign
    - before: nonexistent
    - after: existent

pddl action:
```
(:action create_sos_sign
   :parameters (?p - player ?wood - wood ?stone - stone ?sos - sos_sign)
   :precondition (and 
                     (inventory ?p ?wood)
                     (inventory ?p ?stone)
                 )
   :effect (inventory ?p ?sos)
)
```
These actions are formulating in a way that after the action is taken, the items used in performing that action are not removed from the player's inventory. If that is a requirement, the effect (not(inventory ?p ?item)) needs to be added to the respective actions.
For the action "pick_fruit":

- action name: pick_fruit
- summarize action: The player picks a fruit from the location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at a location where there is a fruit.
- what is the result: A fruit is in player's inventory.
- entities:
  - entity name: fruit
    - before: at location
    - after: in player's inventory

pddl action:
```
(:action pick_fruit
   :parameters (?p - player ?f - fruit ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and
                    (at ?p ?loc)
                    (has_fruit ?loc)
                 )
   :effect (and
               (inventory ?p ?f)
               (not (has_fruit ?loc))
            )
)
```

- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to have a fruit in their inventory and should be hungry.
- what is the result: The player is no longer hungry, and the fruit is removed from the inventory.
- entities:
  - entity name: fruit
    - before: in player's inventory
    - after: consumed by player

pddl action:
```
(:action eat_fruit
   :parameters (?p - player ?f - fruit)
   :precondition (and
                     (inventory ?p ?f)
                     (is hungry ?p)
                 )
   :effect (and
               (not (is hungry ?p))
               (not (inventory ?p ?f))
            )
)
```

For the action "escape":

As the action "escape" is ambiguous without additional context, it's hard to create an accurate PDDL representation. If "escape" means the player manages to leave the jungle, it could be represented as a goal state in the problem definition rather than as an action. If there are specific steps the player needs to undertake to "escape", these could be formulated as separate actions.

For the action "escape", assuming it represents that the player leaves the location (is no longer at any location) after creating an SOS sign, here are the summarization and PDDL representation:

- action name: escape
- summarize action: The player escapes the location after creating an SOS sign.
- what is needed to do the action: The player requires an SOS sign in their inventory.
- what is the result: The player is no longer at any known location, indicating they have escaped.
- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at a known location
    - after: no longer at any known location 

pddl action:
```
(:action escape
   :parameters (?p - player ?sos - sos_sign ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and
                     (inventory ?p ?sos)
                     (at ?p ?loc)
                 )
   :effect (and
               (not (at ?p ?loc))
            )
)
```
Please note: Your model may require expanding upon the above for specific needs, such as specifying which specific locations can be escaped from, or adding effects to represent successful escape, e.g., achieving an "escaped" state.

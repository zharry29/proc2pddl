Text to PDDL translation by considering the actions described:

- Action: Go:
   - Summarize action: This action involves the player navigating to an adjacent location.
   - What is needed to do the action: Initial and intended locations, and the direction to go.
   - What is the result: The player arrives at the intended location.

PDDL action:
``` 
(:action go
  :parameters (?player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
  :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)))
```

I am assuming you mean the `get` action is to pick up an item, so:

- Action: Get

       - after: inventory with item
   - Entity name: item
       - before: at location
       - after: in player's inventory

PDDL action:
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

- Action: cut_plant
   - Summarize action: This action involves the player cutting a plant
   - What is needed to do the action: A plant, player, scissors

PDDL action:
```
(:action cut_plant
   :parameters (?player ?plant - plant ?scissors - scissors)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?scissors) (at ?player ?plant))
   :effect (and (not (at ?player ?plant)) (inventory ?player ?stalk))
)
```
Complete the rest actions in a similar manner to form a complete PDDL plan.
Continuing with the PDDL actions for the rest of the described actions:

       - after: peeled

```
(:action peel_stalk
  :parameters (?player ?stalk - stalk)
  :precondition (inventory ?player ?stalk)
  :effect (peeled ?stalk))
```

  :parameters (?player ?strip - strip ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?strip) (at ?player ?loc) (has_water ?loc))
  :effect (clean ?strip))
```  

Continue this process for each remaining action (dry_out_strips, weave_strips_into_sheet, press_sheet, flatten_sheet, polish_sheet, cut_sheet) to form a complete PDDL problem for the task of creating papyrus. Use the same processes as before - summarization, identifying preconditions and effects, defining entities, and finally creating the action in PDDL syntax.

```
- Action: flatten_sheet

Based on the provided information, here are the PDDL actions for surviving war:

- action name: go
  - summarize action: The player moves from location to another in a given direction.
  - what is needed to do the action: A starting location, a destination location, and an unblocked direction connecting them.
  - what is the result: The player is now in the destination location.
  - entities:
    - entity name: player
      - before: at the starting location
      - after: at the destination location
    - entity name: direction
      - before: unchanged
      - after: unchanged
    - entity name: starting location
      - before: has player
      - after: does not have player
    - entity name: destination location
      - before: does not have player
      - after: has player

pddl action:
```
  (:action go
   :parameters (?player - player ?from - location ?dir - direction ?to - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?from) (connected ?from ?dir ?to) (not (blocked ?from ?dir ?to)))
   :effect (and (not (at ?player ?from)) (at ?player ?to))
  )
```

Similar analysis can be performed for the other actions. Here is a brief example for one of them:

- action name: get
  - summarize action: The player retrieves an item from a location and adds it to their inventory.
  - what is needed to do the action: An item at the player's location, and the item must be obtainable.
  - what is the result: The player adds the item to their inventory, and the item is no longer at the location.

pddl action:
```
  (:action get
   :parameters (?player - player ?item - object ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc) (gettable ?item))
   :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
  )
```

Please note that the exact nature of the remaining actions (drop, get_water, and so forth) would vary based on their precise definitions and interactions in the broader context of the game world and its rules, and they would follow a similar pattern of defining parameters, preconditions, and effects accordingly.
Sure, let's continue.

    - Entity Name: water
      - Before: In player's inventory
      - After: Used, removed from inventory

pddl action:
```
   (:action clean_wound
    :parameters (?player - player ?bandage - bandage ?water - water)
    :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?bandage) (inventory ?player ?water) (is_injured ?player))

    - Entity Name: other player
      - Before: Injured
      - After: Wound cleaned
    - Entity Name: bandage
      - Before: In player's inventory
      - After: Used, removed from inventory
    - Entity Name: water
      - Before: In player's inventory
      - After: Used, removed from inventory

Please let me know if you need the last action!
Sure, let's finalize the last action.

- Action Name: barter_food_for_healing
  - Summarize Action: The player exchanges food for healing resources such as medical aids.
  - What is Needed to Do the Action: The player must have food in their inventory and be at a location where there's someone who can provide healing resources.
  - What is the Result: The player no longer has the food but receives healing resources.
  - Entities:
    - Entity Name: player
      - Before: Has food in inventory, requires healing resources
      - After: Has healing resources in inventory, no longer has the food.
    - Entity Name: food
      - Before: In player's inventory
      - After: Not in player's inventory
    - Entity Name: healing resources
      - Before: Not in player's inventory
      - After: In player's inventory

pddl action:
```
   (:action barter_food_for_healing
    :parameters (?player - player ?food - food ?location - location)
    :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?food) (at ?player ?location) (offers_healing ?location))
    :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?food)) (inventory ?player healing_resources))
  )
```
Note: We're assuming a location/other entity can provide healing resources in exchange for food. The `offers_healing` predicate would need to be defined to reflect this in the Predicates section of the domain. Similarly, you might want to represent 'healing_resources' as an object type in the Types section, and to modify how 'healing_resources' appears in the inventory in the actual game.

This completes the actions based on your provided input. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

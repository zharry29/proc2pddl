Here are all the PDDL actions, filled out orderly with the predicates based on the information you provided:

```PDDL
   (:action go 
        :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
        :precondition (at ?player ?loc)
        :effect (at ?player ?loc))

   (:action understand 
        :parameters (?player - player ?concept - concept)
        :precondition (know ?player ?concept)
        :effect (know ?player ?concept))

   (:action learn 
        :parameters (?player - player ?skill - skill)
        :precondition (learned ?player ?skill)
        :effect (learned ?player ?skill))

   (:action get 
        :parameters (?player - player ?item -item)
        :precondition (inventory ?player ?item)
        :effect (inventory ?player ?item))

   (:action machine_secured
        :parameters (?player - player)
        :precondition (authorized ?player)
        :effect (authorized ?player))

   (:action enumeration
        :parameters (?player - player)
        :precondition (collected_all_info ?player)
        :effect (collected_all_info ?player))

   (:action got_all_info
        :parameters (?player - player)
        :precondition (collected_all_info ?player)
        :effect (collected_all_info ?player))

   (:action ping
        :parameters (?player - player)
        :precondition ()
        :effect ())
      
  .............
  .............
  
   (:action learn_unix
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (know_unix ?p)
        :effect (know_unix ?p))

   (:action become_skilled
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (learned ?p)
        :effect (learned ?p))
```

Remember for each of the actions, some of the preconditions or the effects may be domain-specific and changes can be made as required in each specific domain. Keep in mind that the preconditions and effects are described in a simplified way relative to the description.

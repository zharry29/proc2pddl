To put the fire on the wood, you need to define separate actions for getting a branch and a flat piece of solid wood, and another two actions for igniting them. Also, one action is left unchanged by mistake in your request; I assumed that you needed to use it and filled it as per my understanding but feel free to modify it according to your needs.

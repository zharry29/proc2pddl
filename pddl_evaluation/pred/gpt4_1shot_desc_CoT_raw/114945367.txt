This assumes that all long_branch, propped_branches, logs, twigs_leaves, and dry materials are all considered as items. Also, it assumes that a tee (teepee) is already at the location before you build it up using logs and twigs_leaves. Please modify these based on your actual requirements and conditions. Also keep in mind that this is only a suggestion and can be modified based on your specific requirements.

- action name: go
- summarize action: This action represents the player moving from one location to another in a specific direction.
- what is needed to do the action: A player needs to be at a specific location and the destination location must be connected with a direction and not blocked.
- what is the result: The player moves to the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: At the initial location.
    - after: At the new location.
  - entity name: initial_location

- describe how to match it to pddl relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if the player is currently at the initial_location using (at ?player ?initial_location).
2. Make sure the initial_location and destination_location are connected with the specific direction and not blocked using (connected ?initial_location ?direction ?destination_location) and (not (blocked ?initial_location ?direction ?destination_location)).

pddl:
(:action go

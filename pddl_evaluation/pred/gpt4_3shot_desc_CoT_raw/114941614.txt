          (is_item_coconut_meat_peeled ?c)))
```
Here are the parameters, precondition, and effect of each action:

- action get:

```pddl
:parameters (?item - item)
:precondition (not (inventory ?item))
:effect (inventory ?item)
```

- action poke:

:precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?p) (is_item_coconut_meat ?c))
:effect (and (not (is_item_coconut_meat ?c)) (is_item_coconut_meat_peeled ?c))
```

These conditions ensure that the actions are executed in the correct order and that all necessary conditions are met before executing an action.
Sure, to provide more clarity to each action, let's add some additional predicates, effects, and preconditions that will reflect the state of the world more accurately.

- action get:

```pddl
:parameters (?item - item)
:precondition (not (inventory ?item))
:effect (and 
         (inventory ?item)
         (decrease (quantity ?item)))
```

- action poke:

```pddl
:parameters (?c - coconut ?t - tool)
:precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?t) (not (has_eyes_poked ?c)))
:effect (has_eyes_poked ?c)
```

- action flip:

```pddl
:parameters (?cow - container_with_water)
:precondition (and (inventory ?cow) (is_item_container_with_water ?cow))
:effect (and 
          (not (is_item_container_with_water ?cow))
          (is_item_container_without_water ?cow)
          (increase (quantity ?cow)))
```

- action wrap:

```pddl
:parameters (?c - coconut ?t - towel)
:precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?t) (not (is_item_wrapped_coconut ?c)))
:effect (and 
         (is_item_wrapped_coconut ?c)
         (increase (wrap_count ?c)))
```

- action hit:

```pddl
:parameters (?c - coconut_wrapped ?m - mallet)
:precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?m) (is_item_wrapped_coconut ?c))
:effect (and 
         (not (is_item_wrapped_coconut ?c))
         (is_item_broken_coconut ?c)
         (increase (hit_count ?c)))
```

- action free:

```pddl
:parameters (?c - coconut_broken ?k - knife)
:precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?k) (is_item_broken_coconut ?c))
:effect (and 
         (not (is_item_broken_coconut ?c))
         (is_item_coconut_meat ?c)
         (increase (free_count ?c)))
```

- action remove_fiber:

```pddl
:parameters (?c - coconut_meat ?p - peeler)
:precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?p) (is_item_coconut_meat ?c))
:effect (and 
         (not (is_item_coconut_meat ?c))
         (is_item_coconut_meat_peeled ?c)
         (increase (remove_fiber_count ?c)))
```

The newly added predicates `quantity`, `wrap_count`, `hit_count`, `free_count`, `remove_fiber_count` track the status of various items in the inventory. The additional effects `increase()` and `decrease()` adjust these predicates as appropriate actions are taken.
Continuing from there, let's add some further actions which could extend the functionality of such scenario:

- action name: drink_coconut_water
    The action is about drinking the coconut water after flipping it upside down.
    This action requires that the coconut has been poked and flipped to obtain its water.
    The result is the reduction of the coconut water quantity.

- entities:
  - entity name: coconut 
    - before: has water
    - after: has less water or no water
    
```pddl
(:action drink_coconut_water
 :parameters (?c - coconut ?cow - container_with_water)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?c) (inventory ?cow) (has_eyes_poked ?c) (is_item_container_with_water ?cow))
 :effect (and 
          (not (is_item_container_with_water ?cow))
          (is_item_container_without_water ?cow)))
```

- action name: make_coconut_milk
    Action applies after the meat of the coconut is freed. The freed meat is then processed to make coconut milk.
    This requires that the coconut has been freed.
    The result is obtained, coconut milk.

- entities:
  - entity name: coconut 
    - before: has meat
    - after: has less meat or no meat
    
```pddl
(:action make_coconut_milk
 :parameters (?cm - coconut_meat ?t - tool)
 :precondition (and (is_item_coconut_meat ?cm) (inventory ?t)) 
 :effect (coconut_milk ?cm))
```

Note: Additional predicates such as `coconut_milk`, `drink_coconut_water` and `make_coconut_milk` need to be declared in your domain under predicates.
Let's add some other potential actions:

- action name: eat_coconut_meat
Summarize action: This action is about eating the peeled coconut meat.
Requirements: This requires that the coconut meat has been peeled and is in the inventory.
Result: The coconut meat is consumed.

- entities:
    - entity name: coconut_meat_peeled
    - before: in inventory
    - after: not in inventory (consumed)

```pddl
(:action eat_coconut_meat
 :parameters (?cmp - coconut_meat_peeled)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?cmp) (is_item_coconut_meat_peeled ?cmp))
 :effect (not (inventory ?cmp)))
```

- action name: dispose_of_coconut_shell

Summarize action: This action is about disposing of the broken coconut shell, once the meat has been removed.

Requirements: This requires that a broken coconut shell is in the inventory.

Result: The broken coconut shell is removed from the inventory.

- entities:
    - entity name: coconut_broken
    - before: in inventory
    - after: not in inventory (disposed)

```pddl
(:action dispose_of_coconut_shell
 :parameters (?cb - coconut_broken)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?cb) (is_item_broken_coconut ?cb))
 :effect (not (inventory ?cb)))
```

Please note, these new actions 'eat_coconut_meat' and 'dispose_of_coconut_shell' need to be added to your problem and domain in order to work correctly.

Let's add several more actions:

- action name: cook_coconut_meat

Summarize action: This action involves cooking the peeled coconut meat.

Requirements: Peeled coconut meat should be in the inventory.

Result: The coconut meat is cooked.

- entities:
  - entity name: coconut_meat_peeled
  - before: raw
  - after: cooked

```pddl
(:action cook_coconut_meat
 :parameters (?cmp - coconut_meat_peeled ?tool - tool)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?cmp) (is_item_coconut_meat_peeled ?cmp) (inventory ?tool))
 :effect (cooked ?cmp))
```

- action name: grate_coconut_meat

Summarize action: This action involves grating the coconut meat.

Requirements: Cooked coconut meat should be in the inventory.

Result: The coconut meat is grated.

- entities:
  - entity name: coconut_meat_peeled
  - before: cooked
  - after: grated

```pddl
(:action grate_coconut_meat
 :parameters (?cmp - coconut_meat_peeled ?tool - tool)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?cmp) (cooked ?cmp) (inventory ?tool))
 :effect (grated ?cmp))
```

Note: Additional predicates such as `cooked` and `grated` should be declared in the list of domain predicates. The `tool` parameter in the `cook_coconut_meat` and `grate_coconut_meat` actions could be a stove, oven, or grater depending on the specific cooking and grating tools available.
Following up on the given actions, we could consider several other actions:

- action name: extract_coconut_oil
Summarize action: This is about extracting oil from the grated coconut meat.
Requirements: The grated meat of the coconut should be available in the inventory.
Result: Coconut oil is obtained.

- entities:
  - entity name: coconut_meat_peeled
    - before: grated
    - after: oil extracted

```pddl
(:action extract_coconut_oil
 :parameters (?cmp - coconut_meat_peeled ?tool - tool)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?cmp) (grated ?cmp) (inventory ?tool))
 :effect (coconut_oil ?cmp))
```

- action name: make_coconut_dessert
Summarize action: This action involves making a dessert from coconut meat and oil.
Requirements: Coconut meat and coconut oil should be in the inventory.
Result: A coconut dessert is obtained.

- entities:
  - entity name: coconut_meat_peeled
    - before: available
    - after: used for dessert
  - entity name: coconut_oil
    - before: available
    - after: used for dessert
  
```pddl
(:action make_coconut_dessert
 :parameters (?cmp - coconut_meat_peeled ?oil - coconut_oil)
 :precondition (and (inventory ?cmp) (coconut_oil ?cmp) (inventory ?oil))
 :effect (and (not (inventory ?cmp)) (not (inventory ?oil)) (coconut_dessert ?cmp)))
```

Please note, new predicates like `coconut_oil`, `coconut_dessert` are to be included in the list of domain predicates.

I have used all the provided actions: 'get', 'poke', 'flip', 'wrap', 'hit', 'free', 'remove_fiber'. 

Respecting your instructions, I won't add additional actions. Do you want different variations of these actions or need help with anything else? Perhaps you want to describe additional scenarios or provide more actions?
I'm sorry, but your last response is a bit unclear. Could you please provide more detail? Are there more actions or terms you need to be defined or converted into PDDL format, or any other information or assistance you need?
I'm sorry for any confusion, but I'll need more context or a specific question to be able to assist you further. Can you provide more details about what you're looking for? Are there additional actions or scenarios that you want to be addressed?

The actions: 'get', 'poke', 'flip', 'wrap', 'hit', 'free', 'remove_fiber' for the task of opening a coconut were clearly defined and translated into PDDL format. 

If you have another task, different actions, or more details for the current scenario, please provide them.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but I need additional specific inputs to continue. The given actions for opening up a coconut including 'get', 'poke', 'flip', 'wrap', 'hit', 'free', 'remove_fiber' have already been defined and translated into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). If you have additional actions or another scenario you would like translated, could you please provide further details?
I apologize for the confusion, but without further specific instructions, it's difficult to provide the help you're asking for. We've covered seven actions (`get`, `poke`, `flip`, `wrap`, `hit`, `free`, and `remove_fiber`) pertaining to the process of opening a coconut, and these actions have been clearly defined and appropriately translated into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).

If you're seeking assistance with a certain part of this process, a different process entirely, or if you'd like to see this process interpreted differently, please provide more detailed information so that I can best assist you.
I apologize for any misunderstanding, but I'm unsure of how to proceed without more direction. I've defined and converted the given actions into the PDDL format, however, if there are more actions, different scenarios or any other elements you would like to discuss or need help with, kindly provide more context. I would be glad to assist further!
I'm sorry for the confusion, but your request to "continue" is a bit unclear. The actions for opening a coconut, specifically 'get', 'poke', 'flip', 'wrap', 'hit', 'free', and 'remove_fiber', have been defined and translated into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). 

If you would like to proceed with new actions, another scenario, or other aspects of PDDL, please provide those details so I can assist you further.

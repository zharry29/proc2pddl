```
Sorry, I just realized that I made a mistake. I shouldn't have included ?q - quicksand in functions like rest, usestick where it is not needed according to the texts. Here are the corrected actions:

- action name: usestick
pddl action:
```scheme
(:action usestick
  :parameters (?p - player ?i - stick)
  :precondition (inventory ?p ?i)
  :effect (forall (?q - quicksand) (when (stuck ?p ?q) (not (stuck ?p ?q)))))
```

The `stuck` status of the player is removed for any quicksand it's in when using stick.

- action name: rest
pddl action:
```scheme
(:action rest
  :parameters (?p - player)
  :precondition (tired ?p)
  :effect (not (tired ?p)))
```

When a player rests, their 'tired' status is removed.

For a complete version including all the actions, you can follow the format above to finish other actions. Please make sure the preconditions and effects actually make sense according to your problem and your texts. The planning problem based on these actions will depend on the initial state and the goal state.

And just as a note, typically in PDDL we define the parameters first then use them in precondition and effects later, thus they usually appear in most of the actions. But if an entity isn't involved in a particular action, we don't need to include it in the parameters.
Acknowledging your instruction, let's continue with the remaining actions:

- action name: check_ripples
- summarize action: This action involves the player checking the location for ripples, which may indicate the presence of quicksand.
- what is needed to do the action: A player and a location.
- what is the result: The player is aware of possible quicksand in the location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: unaware of quicksand in the location
    - after: aware of quicksand in the location
  - entity name: location
    - before: unchecked for ripples
    - after: checked for ripples

pddl action:
```scheme
(:action check_ripples
 :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (has_ripples ?l))
 :effect (aware ?p ?l))
```

- action name: test_ground
- summarize action: With this action, the player tests the ground to be informed about possible quicksand.
- what is needed to do the action: A player and a location.
- what is the result: The player becomes aware of the nature of the ground at a location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: unaware of the nature of the ground at a location
    - after: aware of the nature of the ground at the location
  - entity name: location
    - before: ground nature not tested
    - after: ground nature tested

pddl action:
```scheme
(:action test_ground
 :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
 :precondition (at ?p ?l)
 :effect (aware ?p ?l))
```

- action name: research
- summarize action: This action represents the player performing research about quicksand, getting informed about possible quicksand at all locations.
- what is needed to do the action: A player.
- what is the result: The player becomes informed about all potential quicksand locations.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: unaware of quicksand locations
    - after: aware of all potential quicksand locations

pddl action:
```scheme
(:action research
 :parameters (?p - player)
 :effect (forall (?loc - location) 
            (aware ?p ?loc)))
```

- action name: move_horizontally
- summarize action: This action signifies the player moving horizontally to escape from the quicksand.
- what is needed to do the action: A player, the location the player is stuck in and the adjacent location the player is trying to reach.
- what is the result: The player no longer being stuck in the quicksand and having successfully reached the adjacent location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: stuck in quicksand at the original location
    - after: free of quicksand and at the adjacent location

pddl action:
```scheme
(:action move_horizontally
 :parameters (?p - player ?from - location ?to - location ?d - direction)
 :precondition (and 
                (at ?p ?from)
                (there_is_quicksand ?from) 
                (connected ?from ?d ?to))
 :effect (and 
          (not (at ?p ?from)) 
          (at ?p ?to)
          (forall (?q - quicksand) 
            (when (stuck ?p ?q) (not (stuck ?p ?q))))))
```

In this action, `there_is_quicksand` is a new predicate indicating that a location has quicksand, which is missing in your provided predicates. If this predicate or any equivalent is not part of your design, you can safely remove it from the action's precondition.
Let's correct the previous PDDL definition for action `move_horizontally`, the field "there is quicksand" is not needed since we can just use the predicate "stuck". 

- action name: move_horizontally
- summarize action: This action involves the player attempting to move horizontally when stuck in quicksand, with the goal of reaching a new location that's adjacent to their current location in the specified direction.
- what is needed to do the action: A player who is currently at a location and stuck in quicksand, an adjacent location reachable from the current location, a direction that leads to the adjacent location.
- what is the result: The player is no longer at the original location and gets unstuck from the quicksand, instead, the player is now at the adjacent location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: at original location, stuck in quicksand
    - after: at adjacent location, not stuck in quicksand
  - entity name: original location
    - before: has the player
    - after: does not have the player
  - entity name: direction
    - before: unchanged
    - after: unchanged
  - entity name: adjacent location
    - before: does not have the player
    - after: has the player

pddl action:
```scheme
(:action move_horizontally
 :parameters (?p - player ?from - location ?d - direction ?to - location)
 :precondition (and 
                (at ?p ?from)
                (exists (?q - quicksand) (stuck ?p ?q))
                (connected ?from ?d ?to))
 :effect (and 
          (not (at ?p ?from)) 
          (at ?p ?to)
          (forall (?q - quicksand) 
            (when (stuck ?p ?q) (not (stuck ?p ?q))))))
```

I've used `exists` in the precondition to ensure the player is indeed stuck in some quicksand before executing this action. Similarly, `forall` is utilized in the effects to ensure the player gets unstuck from any quicksand they may be stuck in. These logical quantifiers are critical for designing robust planning domains.
Given your directive to continue, I presume you would like the predicates associated with those actions to be defined. Here they are following the same order of actions:

- For the `go` action, the predicates involved are `at`, `connected` and `blocked`. `at` checks if the player is at the starting location, `connected` validates if the player can go from the starting location to the targeted one in a specific direction, and `blocked` ensures that the path is not blocked.

```scheme
(at ?p - player ?from - location)
(connected ?from - location ?d - direction ?to - location)
(blocked ?from - location ?d - direction ?to - location)
```

- For the `get` action, the player needs to be at the same location as the item to pick up, represented by the `at` predicate.

```scheme
(at ?p - player ?loc - location)
(at ?i - item ?loc - location)
```

- The `breathe` action does not involve any predicates for its precondition but will cause the `calm` predicate to be true for the player.

- The `liedown` action involves a change of state for the player, so its pre and postconditions involve the `laying` predicate to reflect the player's status.

- For the `swim` action, the player needs to be lying down and stuck in the quicksand, so the `laying` and `stuck` predicates are involved.

- The `usestick` action assumes that the player already has the stick in the inventory and is stuck in the quicksand for it to have effect, so the `inventory` and `stuck` predicates are used.

- The `rest` action involves the `tired` predicate since the player needs to be tired to rest.

- For the `drop` action, the player has to be in the same location as the item and the item needs to be in the player's inventory, so the `at` and `inventory` predicates are involved.

- For the `check_ripples` action, the player needs to be at the location they are checking for ripples, so the `at` predicate is used.

- The `test_ground` action involves the `at` and `aware` predicates. The player needs to be at the location to test the ground, and becomes aware of the location afterward.

- The `research` action does not require any predicates in its precondition, but updates the player's awareness of all locations, thus involving the `aware` predicate.

- The `move_horizontally` action involves `at`, `stuck`, `connected`, and `deep` predicates. The player must be in a location and be stuck in quicksand. The location they are at must be connected to another specific location by a direction. After the action, the player is no longer stuck, and they are at the new location.
Here are the predicates for each action:

- go:

    - at: The predicate "at" ensures that the object (in this case, the player) is at the specified location.
    - connected: This predicate "connected" validates that two locations are connected in specified direction.
    - blocked: The predicate "blocked" verifies if the route between two locations is blocked or not.

- get:

    - at: The predicate "at" ensures that both the player and the item are at same location. 

- breathe:

   - calm: This predicate checks if the player is in a calm state or not. 

- liedown:

    - laying: The predicate "laying" checks whether the player is lying down on their back. 

- swim:

    - laying: In the context of the "swim" action, this predicate checks if the player is lying down on their back.
    - stuck: This predicate represents the state of the player being caught in quicksand.

- usestick:

    - inventory: This predicate validates whether an item is in the inventory of the player.
    - stuck: This predicate represents the state of the player being caught in quicksand.

- rest:

    - tired: The predicate "tired" checks if the player is tired or not.

- drop:

    - at: The predicate "at" validates that player and the item are at the same location.
    - inventory: This predicate verifies that an item is in the player's inventory. 

- check_ripples:

    - at: The predicate "at" ensures that the player is at the specified location.
    - has_ripples: This predicate checks if the location has any ripples signaling the presence of quicksand.

- test_ground:

    - at: This predicate validates that the player is at the specified location.
    - aware: The predicate "aware" checks if the player is aware of possible quicksand at the specified location. 

- research:

    - aware: The predicate "aware" represents the awareness of the player about possible quicksand at all locations.

- move_horizontally:

    - at: The predicate "at" checks if the player is at the specific location.
    - stuck: This predicate represents the state of the player being caught in quicksand.
    - connected: This predicate represents that two locations are connected in a specified direction. 

Note: In these predicate usage explanations, I have also considered the context of the specific action.
Sure, I'll continue explaining some of the key points about the predicates and their role in the PDDL actions.

- `stuck` is particularly essential in the action `move_horizontally`, where it is necessary to identify if the player is trapped in quicksand. Upon successful execution of `move_horizontally`, the player should no longer be stuck (`not (stuck ?p ?q)` in the effect part).

- The `has_ripples` predicate is key to the `check_ripples` action, as it specifies whether the location being checked by the player has ripples, providing clues about possible quicksand. Upon successful completion of the `check_ripples` action, the player becomes aware of the presence or absence of quicksand in that location (`aware ?p ?l` in the effect part).

- `aware` is a key predicate in `test_ground` and `research` actions. In `test_ground`, it is necessary for the player to be at the location to be tested, and post that action, the player becomes 'aware' of the possible presence of quicksand at that location. 

- The `research` action makes use of the logical quantifier `forall`, which iterates over all instances of location (`?loc - location`) and applies the `aware ?p ?loc` effect to them, leading to the player being aware of all the places.

Overall, these predicates help in defining the state of the game environment and facilitate the creation and execution of the actions.

Do note that while your initial list of predicates, 'at', 'inventory', 'connected', 'blocked', 'calm',  'laying', 'tired', 'stuck', 'deep', 'has_ripples', 'aware', 'has_quicksand', covers a lot of scenarios, the specific predicates necessary will depend on the actual actions and their context. New predicates may be added or some might remain unused depending upon the variety of actions and their effects on the environment variables.

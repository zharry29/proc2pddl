(:action learn 
    :parameters (?p - player ?s - skill)
    :precondition (not (learned ?p ?s))
    :effect (learned ?p ?s))

                     (is ?s - password_cracking_skill))
    :effect (password_cracked ?p)) 

Please note that we are assuming the existence of a password_cracking_skill, which should be introduced under the "skill" type. If your specific domain requires to add different skills for different types of password cracking, consider introducing such skills as well. The specific details would require a deeper understanding of your particular use case. These are guidelines based on the provided information.
Sure, let's continue with the next set of actions:

                     (learned ?p ?s)

    :effect (and 
              (not (know ?admin ?ds))
              (stealth ?p ?ds)))
```
Please note that as a convention, the entity name 'player' was used to denote both the hacker and the administrator. If it is necessary to differentiate the types of players, consider introducing new types into the domain such as 'hacker' and 'admin'. 

Also, for installing malware and bypassing systems, we assume the existence of specific skills such as malware_installing_skill, system_bypassing_skill and stealth_skill. Make sure to introduce these skills into the domain and that the "player" has learned these skills before performing the corresponding actions.

                     (additional_users ?ds))
    :effect (not (additional_users ?ds)))
```
Please note that the skill required for these actions and types of checks made are not clearly mentioned in the task. These actions are thus kept simple and do not include these checks.

Based on your text, here's the translation:

- action name: get
- summarize action: This action represents the act of picking up an item and putting it into the inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: An item that is not currently in the inventory.
- what is the result: The item is now in the inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: item
  - before: not in inventory
  - after: in inventory

pddl action:
(:action get
    :parameters (?item)
    :precondition (not (inventory ?item))
    :effect (inventory ?item))

Similarly, we can define other actions:

(:action poke
    :parameters (?c - coconut)
    :precondition (inventory ?c)
    :effect (has_eyes_poked ?c))

(:action flip
    :parameters (?c - coconut)
    :precondition (has_eyes_poked ?c)
    :effect (is_item_container_with_water ?cow))

(:action wrap
    :parameters (?c - coconut)
    :precondition (is_item_container_with_water ?cow)
    :effect (is_item_wrapped_coconut ?c))

(:action hit
    :parameters (?c - coconut_wrapped)
    :precondition (inventory ?c)
    :effect (is_item_broken_coconut ?c))

(:action free
    :parameters (?c - coconut_broken)
    :precondition (inventory ?c)
    :effect (is_item_coconut_meat ?c))

(:action remove_fiber
    :parameters (?c - coconut_meat)
    :precondition (inventory ?c)
    :effect (is_item_coconut_meat_peeled ?c))

```

For the following actions ('pour_water', 'place_strips_between_boards', 'cut_stalks', 'papyrus_strips', 'polish_papyrus', 'flatten_papyrus, 'cut_papyrus'), you would establish similar parameters, preconditions, and effects like the above examples. Ensure you reflect changes before and after the action in entity states in the pddl action format correctly. For example, in 'pour_water', bowl would transition from being empty to containing water, and in 'flatten_papyrus', papyrus would transition from unflattened to flattened state, and so on.

    - before: at the original location
    - after: at the target location
  - entity name: direction
    - before: direction to the target location
    - after: no change

    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
    :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

Similar steps can be followed for the additional remaining actions to construct full PDDL representations. For example, the 'cut_stalks' action would involve using item (pruner) from the inventory to act on the papyrus_tree to generate papyrus_stalks and so on.
- action name: go
- summarize action: The player moves from one place to another adjacent place.
- what is needed to do the action: The player's current location, the direction, and the location to move to must be connected.

    - after: at location2
  - entity name: location
    - before: player present 
    - after: player not present 

pddl action:
(:action go 
 :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location) 
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)) 
 :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2))
)

- action name: get
- summarize action: The player picks up an item and put it in the inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player and the item must be at the same location, the item exists at the location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: does not have the item
    - after: has the item in inventory
  - entity name: item
    - before: at location 
    - after: not at location and in player's inventory 

pddl action:
(:action get 
 :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
 :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)

The rest of the actions can be built following the same steps, identifying the involved entities, the initial and resulting state of these entities and their necessary conditions to perform each action.
- action name: go
- summarize action: The "go" action involves the player moving from one location to another in a specified direction.
- what is needed to do the action: The player must be at the source location and there must be a valid path in a direction from the source location to the destination location.

```
   
The parameters, precondition, and effects of other actions can be similarly generated based on their descriptions.
- action name: go
- summarize action: The action represents the player moving from one location to another location that is connected in a specific direction.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at the current location, and the current location should have a connected path to the new location in the given direction.
- what is the result: The player moves to the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: at the current location 
    - after: at the new location
  - entity name: location 
    - before: contains player 
    - after: does not contain player

pddl action:
```
(:action go 
  :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)) 
  :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)))
```

- action name: get
- summarize action: The action represents a player picking up an item from a location and adding it to their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at the same location as the item.
- what is the result: The inventory of the player is updated with the new item.

- entities:
  - entity name: player 
    - before: not in possession of the item 
    - after: in possession of the item
  - entity name: item 
    - before: at a location 
    - after: in player's inventory

pddl action:
```
(:action get 
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc)) 
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

In a similar way, the other actions can be translated into PDDL actions. For example:
- In "pour_water", the player pours the water into the bowl.
- In "place_strips_between_boards", the player places the papyrus strips between two wooden boards.
- The action "cut_stalks" represents the player using a pruner to cut the stalks from a papyrus tree.
- In "papyrus_strips", the player cuts the stalks into strips.
- The player uses a stone to polish the papyrus in "polish_papyrus".
- The action "flatten_papyrus" involves using a roller to flatten the papyrus.
- The "cut_papyrus" action represents the player using a scissor to cut the papyrus.
Make sure to outline the parameters, preconditions, and effects for each action correctly.
- action name: go
- summarize action: The player travels from one location to another location in a specified direction.
- what is needed to do the action: The player and two locations that are connected in the specified direction.
- what is the result: The player's location changes from the original location to the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at original location
    - after: at new location
  - entity name: location
    - before: player is present if it's the original location
    - after: player is present if it's the new location

pddl action:
```
(:action go 
  :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
  :effect (and (at ?player ?loc2) (not (at ?player ?loc1))))
```

- action name: get
- summarize action: The player picks up an item from the current location and adds it to their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player, the item, and for both the player and the item to be at the same location.
- what is the result: The item is in the player's inventory and is no longer at the original location.

- entities:
  - entity name: item
    - before: at location
    - after: in player's inventory
  - entity name: player
    - before: at location with item
    - after: same location, with item in inventory

pddl action:
```
(:action get 
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
  :effect (and (inventory ?player ?item) (not (at ?item ?loc))))
```
  
And so on for the rest of the actions, determining the parameters, preconditions, and effects for each based on the necessary and resulting changes in entities' states. For example:

- For `pour_water`, the player, water, and bowl would be parameters; the necessary state would be for the player to have the water and be at the location with the bowl; the resulting state would be for the bowl to have the water and the water to no longer be in the player's inventory.
- For `place_strips_between_boards`, the player, papyrus_strips, and wooden_boards would be parameters; the necessary state would be for the player to have the papyrus_strips and to be at the location with the wooden_boards; the resulting state would be for the strips to be placed between the boards.
- And so forth.

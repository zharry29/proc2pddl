- action name: test_ground 
No detail provided. Can't write PDDL action without more information.

- action name: research 
No detail provided. Can't write PDDL action without more information.

- action name: move_horizontally
No detail provided. Can't write PDDL action without more information.
Your instructions require additional act descriptions and specifications for the following actions:
- test_ground
- research 
- move_horizontally

Assuming some possible definitions based on common usage and inference, I'll provide the PDDL for these actions. If these definitions do not match your expectations, please provide additional context or detail for these actions!

- action name: test_ground 
With an assumption: this action allows the player to test if the ground at their location has quicksand.
```pddl
(:action test_ground
 :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
 :precondition (at ?p ?loc)
 :effect (if (has_quicksand ?loc) (aware ?p ?loc))
)
```

- action name: research 
With an assumption: this action allows the player to research a location, becoming aware of all properties such as quicksand, ripples etc.
```pddl

 :effect (and (if (has_quicksand ?loc) (aware ?p ?loc)) (if (has_ripples ?loc) (aware ?p ?loc)))
)
```

- action name: move_horizontally 
With an assumption: this action allows the player to move horizontally in quicksand. This action would not be possible if the quicksand is deep.
```pddl

  :effect (and (not (at ?p ?loc1)) (at ?p ?loc2))
)
```
Since you requested for a continuation but did not specify further actions or requirements, I'll assume the continuation means a need for more specialized actions for dealing with quicksand. Given the gaming context and typical actions involved, here are some more actions:

If you have other actions in mind / if you want additions or modifications to these or previous actions, please provide more context or instructions.

Note: These actions are created based on common actions a person might take when encountering quicksand and overlooking the specified predicates. These may not align perfectly with your game's design and intent. Please make sure to adjust or add details as necessary.
Sure, let's continue with more actions that could be used in this quicksand scenario. Remember, these are generic actions and their preconditions and effects can be adjusted according to the specific logic of your game and the capabilities of your character.

- Action name: use_item

```
  
- Action name: throw_item
Assumed Action: The player throws an item, perhaps to reduce their weight in quicksand or to try and rope their item.

```
Remember, you can adjust these actions, their parameters, preconditions, and effects to better suit the specific needs and logic of your game environment and characters.
Certainly, here are some additional actions that can be used in this quicksand scenario:

- Action name: move_slowly

```pddl
(:action move_slowly

 :effect (and (not (deep ?q)) (calm ?p))
)
```

- Action name: make_quick_moves

As before, please adjust these actions, their preconditions, and effects to better suit the particular needs and logic of your game environment and characters.
Certainly, let's create some more actions that could occur in this adventure scenario:

- Action name: signal_location

These actions should offer a diverse range of possible player interactions in a quicksand scenario. Once again, the preconditions and effects of these actions might need to be customized to fit the specific logic and rules of your game.
Sure, let's look at more PDDL actions that might be applicable in escaping quicksand scenario:

- Action name: call_animal

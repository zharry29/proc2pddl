PDDL:
You can't translate this directly to PDDL as it lacks the ability to count facts (members in the society). You could handle this by adding actions that add or remove members and increment/decrement a "counter" (another predicate representing large enough group). For simplicity the counter is omitted, assuming `is_cult` action is performed when the group gets large enough.

(:action check_if_cult
   :parameters (?sc - secret_society)
   :precondition (society_is_ready ?sc)
   :effect (is_cult ?sc)
)
I apologize for the confusion, but there are no additional actions mentioned in the requirements provided to continue with. The actions given were covered with their summarisations, requirements, results, involved entities, and changes which were translated to PDDL. If you have more actions that need PDDL translations, please provide them.

- initiate_new_member
- teach_new_member_secret

If there are more actions, could you please provide them for me to further assist? Otherwise, the actions provided have all been covered and summarized in the PDDL format.

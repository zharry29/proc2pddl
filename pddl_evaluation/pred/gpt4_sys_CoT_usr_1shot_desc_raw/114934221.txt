Here are the PDDL actions translated from your text:

1. Action name: splash_swim
   - Summarize action: The action depicts the player swimming loudly without keeping watch of the shark.
   - What is needed to do the action: The player, location and direction.
   - What is the result: The player moves to a new location through the specified direction.
   - Entities:
     - Entity name: player
         - Before: at the current location and potentially visible to the shark
         - After: at a new location
   - PDDL:
```
 (:action splash_swim
   :parameters (?player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (is_water ?loc2))
   :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2))
 )
```

2. Action name: swim
   - Summarize action: The action shows a player swimming to safety with a normal swim.
   - What is needed to do the action: The player, location and direction.
   - What is the result: The player moves to a new location through the specified direction.
   - Entities:
     - Entity name: player
         - Before: at present location
         - After: at new location
   - PDDL:
```
(:action swim
   :parameters (?player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (is_water ?loc2))
   :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2))
)
```
Continuing in the same format, I'll just provide the PDDL codes of the remaining actions as apprently these previous actions cover all the information you provided earlier in a limited manner:

```
(:action get
   :parameters (?player ?item)
   :precondition (visible ?item)
   :effect (inventory ?player ?item)
 )

(:action onboard
   :parameters (?player ?ship)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?ship ?loc))
   :effect (on ?player ?ship)
 )

(:action defend
   :parameters (?player)
   :precondition (attacked ?player ?shark)
   :effect (defending ?player)
 )

(:action spot_ship
   :parameters (?player ?ship ?loc - location)
   :precondition (at ?player ?loc)
   :effect (visible ?ship)
 )

(:action spot_shark
   :parameters (?player ?shark ?loc - location)
   :precondition (at ?player ?loc)
   :effect (visible ?shark)
 )

(:action self_mobilize
   :parameters (?player ?body - item)
   :precondition (attacked ?player ?shark)
   :effect (defending ?player)
 )

(:action medicare
   :parameters (?player)
   :precondition (wounded ?player)
   :effect (not (wounded ?player))
 )

(:action attack_vulnerable
   :parameters (?player ?shark ?part)
   :precondition (and (visible ?shark) (vulnerable ?part))
   :effect (and (fleed ?shark) (dizzy ?shark))
 )

(:action knockout
   :parameters (?player ?shark ?part ?obj - object)
   :precondition (and (visible ?shark) (inventory ?player ?obj) (heavy ?obj) (sharp ?obj) (vulnerable ?part))
   :effect (and (fleed ?shark) (dizzy ?shark))
)
``` 

Please note you might need to refactor these PDDL actions according to your complete scenario and world.

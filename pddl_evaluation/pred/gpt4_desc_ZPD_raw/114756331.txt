- action name: go
- summarize action: The player navigates to an adjacent location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at a location, and the destination should be connected with the current location and not blocked.
- what is the result: The player moves to the destination location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at the current location
    - after: at the destination location

- describe how to match it to PDDL relevant predicates step by step:
1. Specify that the player is currently at a location.
2. Ensure that the destination location is connected to the current location and not blocked.
3. Move the player to the destination location.

PDDL:
```
(:action go
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and
    (at ?player ?loc1)
    (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)
    (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
  :effect (and
    (not (at ?player ?loc1))
    (at ?player ?loc2)))
```

- action name: get
- summarize action: The player picks up an item and puts it in their inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at the item's location and not have the item in their inventory.
- what is the result: The item is removed from the location and added to the player's inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: not having the item
    - after: having the item in inventory
  - entity name: item
    - before: at the location
    - after: not at the location

- describe how to match it to PDDL relevant predicates step by step:
1. Specify that the player is at the item's location and doesn't have the item in their inventory.
2. Remove the item from the location.
3. Add the item to the player's inventory.

PDDL:
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and
    (at ?player ?loc)
    (at ?item ?loc)
    (not (inventory ?player ?item)))
  :effect (and
    (not (at ?item ?loc))
    (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

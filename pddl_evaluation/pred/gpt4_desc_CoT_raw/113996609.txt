Let's start creating the PDDL for each action one by one:

1. Action Name: go
   Parameters: (player - human) (loc - location)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc1) (?loc1 is connected to ?loc2 in a specific direction)
   Effect: (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)
   PDDL: 
   ```
    (:action go
    :parameters (?player - human ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc))
    :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc)))
   ```

2. Action Name: get
   Parameters: (player - human) (item - item) (loc - location)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc)
   Effect: (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)
   PDDL: 
   ```
   (:action get
   :parameters (?player - human ?item - item ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
   :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
   ```

3. Action Name: get_water
   Parameters: (player - human) (water - water) (loc - location)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_water_source ?loc)
   Effect: (inventory ?player ?water)
   PDDL: 
   ```
   (:action get_water
   :parameters (?player - human ?water - water ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_water_source ?loc))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?water))
   ```

Please note these examples, as the other actions would follow a similar process when creating their PDDL. Let's skip to the action list and add them:

4. chop_wood 
5. carve_groove 
6. light_fire 
7. build_shelter 
8. clean_water 
9. drink_water 
10. find_other_survivors 
11. build_raft 
12. make_weapon 
13. hunt_fish 
14. cook_fish 

For sake of time and space, I will only complete the first three actions. However, other actions can be created in a similar manner.
4. Action Name: chop_wood
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?wood - wood) (?loc - location)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_wood ?loc)
   Effect: (not (has_wood ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?wood)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action chop_wood
   :parameters (?player - human ?wood - wood ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_wood ?loc))
   :effect (and (not (has_wood ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?wood)))
   ```

5. Action Name: carve_groove
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?wood - wood)
   Precondition: (inventory ?player ?wood)
   Effect: (groove ?wood)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action carve_groove
   :parameters (?player - human ?wood - wood)
   :precondition (inventory ?player ?wood)
   :effect (groove ?wood))
   ```

6. Action Name: light_fire
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?loc - location) (?wood - wood)
   Precondition: (player ?player ?loc) (can_light_fire ?loc) (groove ?wood)
   Effect: (has_fire ?loc)
   PDDL: 
   ```
   (:action light_fire
   :parameters (?player - human ?loc - location ?wood - wood)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (can_light_fire ?loc) (groove ?wood))
   :effect (has_fire ?loc))
   ```

And so on for the rest of the actions. Each action in your list will require parameters, preconditions, and effects and be formatted in the typical PDDL fashion. Each action's preconditions and effects are dependent on the action itself, the objects involved, and your specific predicates.
7. Action Name: build_shelter
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?loc - location) (?wood - wood)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (is_safe ?loc) (inventory ?player ?wood)
   Effect: (has_shelter ?loc)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action build_shelter
   :parameters (?player - human ?loc - location ?wood - wood)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (is_safe ?loc) (inventory ?player ?wood))
   :effect (has_shelter ?loc))
   ```

8. Action Name: clean_water
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?water - water) (?loc - location)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_fire ?loc) (inventory ?player ?water)
   Effect: (treated ?water)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action clean_water
   :parameters (?player - human ?water - water ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_fire ?loc) (inventory ?player ?water))
   :effect (treated ?water))
   ```

9. Action Name: drink_water
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?water - water)
   Precondition: (inventory ?player ?water) (treated ?water)
   Effect: (drank ?water)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action drink_water
   :parameters (?player - human ?water - water)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?water) (treated ?water))
   :effect (drank ?water))
   ```

10. Action Name: find_other_survivors
    Parameters: (?player - human) (?survivor - survivor) (?loc - location)
    Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (at ?survivor ?loc)
    Effect: (has_friend ?survivor)
    PDDL:
    ```
    (:action find_other_survivors
    :parameters (?player - human ?survivor - survivor ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?survivor ?loc))
    :effect (has_friend ?survivor))
    ```

Please continue in this way for the remaining actions.
11. Action Name: build_raft
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?raft - raft) (?loc - location) (?wood - wood) (?vines - vines)
   Precondition: (inventory ?player ?wood) (inventory ?player ?vines) (at ?player ?loc) (at_ocean ?loc)
   Effect: (has_escaped ?player)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action build_raft
   :parameters (?player - human ?raft - raft ?loc - location ?wood - wood ?vines - vines)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?wood) (inventory ?player ?vines) (at ?player ?loc) (at_ocean ?loc))
   :effect (has_escaped ?player))
   ```

12. Action Name: make_weapon
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?spear - spear) (?wood - wood) (?rock - rock)
   Precondition: (inventory ?player ?wood) (inventory ?player ?rock)
   Effect: (inventory ?player ?spear)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action make_weapon
   :parameters (?player - human ?spear - spear ?wood - wood ?rock - rock)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?wood) (inventory ?player ?rock))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?spear))
   ```

13. Action Name: hunt_fish
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?fish - fish) (?loc - location) (?spear - spear)
   Precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_fish ?loc) (inventory ?player ?spear)
   Effect: (inventory ?player ?fish)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action hunt_fish
   :parameters (?player - human ?fish - fish ?loc - location ?spear - spear)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_fish ?loc) (inventory ?player ?spear))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?fish))
   ```

14. Action Name: cook_fish
   Parameters: (?player - human) (?fish - fish) (?loc - location) (?fire - fire)
   Precondition: (inventory ?player ?fish) (at ?player ?loc) (has_fire ?loc)
   Effect: (cooked ?fish)
   PDDL:
   ```
   (:action cook_fish
   :parameters (?player - human ?fish - fish ?loc - location ?fire - fire)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?fish) (at ?player ?loc) (has_fire ?loc))
   :effect (cooked ?fish))
   ```

This completes all the actions needed to survive on a deserted island.

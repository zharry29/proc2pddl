- action name: go
- parameters: player, direction, location1, location2
- precondition: the player is at location1 and location1 is connected to location2 in the direction, and the connection is not blocked
- effect: the player is not at location1 but at location2
- pddl:
```
(:action go
   :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
   :effect (and 
        (not (at ?player ?loc1))
        (at ?player ?loc2))
)
```

- action name: get
- parameters: player, item, location
- precondition: the player is at the location and the item is at the same location
- effect: the player now has the item in their inventory, the item is not at the location
- pddl:
```
(:action get
   :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
   :effect (and
        (not (at ?item ?loc))
        (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```

- action name: get_water
- parameters: player, water, location
- precondition: the player is at the location and the location has a water source
- effect: the player now has the untreated water in their inventory
- pddl:
```
(:action get_water
   :parameters (?player - player ?water - water ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_water_source ?loc))
   :effect (inventory ?player ?water))
)
```

- action name: sharpen_stick
- parameters: player, stick
- precondition: the player has the stick in their inventory
- effect: ...
- pddl:

I need more information or another predicate to show that a stick was sharpened in the effect. For instance, if we had a `(sharpened ?stick - stick)` predicate, the PDDL for the sharpen_stick action could be:
```
(:action sharpen_stick
   :parameters (?player - player ?stick - stick)
   :precondition (inventory ?player ?stick)
   :effect (sharpened ?stick))
)
```

...and so on. 

Ensure that the specified preconditions are all logical and fall within the predicates available. The PDDL actions should reflect all possible actions that the player can take given their current state, the items in their possession, and the state of the environment.

The other actions (get_water, start_fire, get_tarp, get_leave, construct_shelter) would be constructed in a similar manner, matching the parameters, preconditions, and effects to the given predicates and creating a matching PDDL statement. Please notice that sometimes you meed more predicates or parameters as given to be able to formulate all actions correctly.
Sure, let's continue with the remaining actions.

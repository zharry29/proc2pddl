Sounds good! Let's create PDDL actions based on your specifications. Remember that actions in PDDL consist of three main fields: parameters, preconditions, and effects. 

The first action is 'go'. We need to define its parameters, preconditions and effects as follows:

1.Parameters: These are the participants involved in the action. Here, we need the player, direction, and location.

2.Preconditions: Preconditions are the conditions that must be achieved before the action takes place. In this case, locations are connected, but the pathway is not blocked.

3.Effects: The effects section indicates the changes that happen after the action. Here, the player moves to the new location.

This is how we can write the 'go' action in PDDL:

    (:action go
        :parameters (?p - player ?d - direction ?l1 - location ?l2 - location)
        :precondition (and (connected ?l1 ?d ?l2) 
                            (not (blocked ?l1 ?d ?l2)) 
                            (at ?p ?l1))
        :effect (and (not (at ?p ?l1)) 
                     (at ?p ?l2)))

Let's move to the next action 'get':

1.Parameters: The player and the item are the participants involved.

2.Preconditions: The item must be at the same location as the player.

3.Effects: The item is removed from the location and added to the player's inventory.

Here is the 'get' action in PDDL:

    (:action get
        :parameters (?p - player ?i - item)
        :precondition (at ?i ?p)
        :effect (and (not (at ?i ?p)) 
                     (inventory ?p ?i)))

To accurately create the remaining actions, your other predicates are needed. Always remember to follow the process I have shown you: determine the parameters, understand what preconditions should exist for the action to occur, and identify the results (effects) of the action.
Now let's proceed systematically with the rest of the actions.

For 'breathe':

1.Parameters: The player who needs to breathe.

2.Preconditions: The player should not be calm (perhaps they're panicking because they're stuck in quicksand).

3.Effects: After the action, the player becomes calm.

In PDDL:

    (:action breathe
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (not (calm ?p)) 
        :effect (calm ?p))

Regarding 'liedown':

1.Parameters: The player.

2.Preconditions: The player should be stuck in quicksand and not yet laying.

3.Effects: The player is now laying.

In PDDL:

    (:action liedown
        :parameters (?p - player ?q - quicksand)
        :precondition (and (stuck ?p ?q) (not (laying ?p))) 
        :effect (laying ?p))

Onto 'swim':

1.Parameters: The player and the quicksand.

2.Preconditions: The player is laying down and isn't yet tired.

3.Effects: The player becomes tired.

In PDDL:

    (:action swim
        :parameters (?p - player ?q - quicksand)
        :precondition (and (laying ?p) (deep ?q) (not (tired ?p)))
        :effect (tired ?p))

In case of 'usestick':

1.Parameters: The player, the stick and the quicksand.

2.Preconditions: The stick is in the player's inventory and the player isn't yet free.

3.Effects: The player gets unstuck from the quicksand.

In PDDL:

    (:action usestick
        :parameters (?p - player ?i - item ?q - quicksand)
        :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?i) (stuck ?p ?q)) 
        :effect (not (stuck ?p ?q)))

For 'rest':

1.Parameters: The player.

2.Preconditions: The player should be tired.

3.Effects: The player is no longer tired.

In PDDL:

    (:action rest
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (tired ?p) 
        :effect (not (tired ?p)))

For the 'drop' action:

1.Parameters: The player and the item.

2.Preconditions: The item should be in the player's inventory.

3.Effects: The item is removed from the inventory and returns to the location.

In PDDL:

    (:action drop
        :parameters (?p - player ?i - item)
        :precondition (inventory ?p ?i) 
        :effect (and (not (inventory ?p ?i)) 
                      (at ?i ?loc)))

For 'check_ripples':

1.Parameters: The player and the location.

2.Preconditions: None specifically.

3.Effects: The player becomes aware of the location (having ripples).

In PDDL:

    (:action check_ripples
        :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
        :effect (aware ?p ?l))

We'll continue with 'test_ground', 'research' and 'move_horizontally', once we get an understanding of what those actions mean and what their preconditions and effects are.
Next, we have 'test_ground':

1. Parameters: The player and the location. 

2. Preconditions: The player should be aware of the location.

3. Effects: If the location has quicksand, this fact is now known to the player.

In PDDL:

    (:action test_ground
        :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)
        :precondition (aware ?p ?l)
        :effect (when (has_quicksand ?l) (known (has_quicksand ?l))))

Subsequently, 'research':

1. Parameters: Simply the player, as they're doing research on their own.

2. Preconditions: None required, as research can always be done.

3. Effects: Let's assume that after doing research, the player knows the location of the quicksand.

In PDDL:

    (:action research
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :effect (forall (?l) (when (has_quicksand ?l) (known (has_quicksand ?l)))))

Finally, 'move_horizontally':

1. Parameters: The player, the quicksand, and the direction.

2. Preconditions: The player is laying and not yet free from the quicksand.

3. Effects: The player becomes free from the quicksand.

In PDDL:

    (:action move_horizontally
        :parameters (?p - player ?q - quicksand ?d - direction)
        :precondition (and (laying ?p) (stuck ?p ?q))
        :effect (not (stuck ?p ?q)))

And that's it! All of the actions are defined in PDDL, fitting the given predicates and types.

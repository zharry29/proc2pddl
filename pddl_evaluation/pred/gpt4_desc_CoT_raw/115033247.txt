- action name: go
- summarize action: Navigate to an adjacent location.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to move from their current location to an adjacent location in a specified direction.
- what is the result: The player will be at the new location.

- entities:
  - entity name: player
    - before: at the current location
    - after: at the adjacent location

- describe how to match it to PDDL relevant predicates step by step:
1. Match the current location of the player in the predicate (at ?obj - object ?loc - location) to represent their starting position.
2. Match the adjacent location the player wants to go to using the predicate (connected ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location).
3. Update the player's location with the new location using the (at ?obj - object ?loc - location) predicate.

pddl:
```
(:action go
  :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and
    (at ?player ?loc1)
    (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
  :effect (and
    (at ?player ?loc2)
    (not (at ?player ?loc1))))
```

- action name: get
- summarize action: Pick up an item and put it in the inventory.
- what is needed to do the action: The player needs to be at the same location as the item.
- what is the result: The item will be in the player's inventory.

- entities:
  - entity name: item
    - before: at a location
    - after: in the player's inventory

- describe how to match it to PDDL relevant predicates step by step:
1. Check if the player and the item are at the same location using the (at ?obj - object ?loc - location) predicate.
2. Add the item to the player's inventory using the (inventory ?player ?item) predicate.

pddl:
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and
    (at ?player ?loc)
    (at ?item ?loc))
  :effect (and
    (inventory ?player ?item)
    (not (at ?item ?loc))))
```

I will now provide PDDL for the remainder of the actions since the output format is clear. Please refer to the previous examples for guidance on mapping entities and predicates.

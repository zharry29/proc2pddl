Sure, let's begin by breaking down each action into PDDL format based on your requirements.

1. Action name: go
   - parameters: (a player, a direction)
   - precondition: the player is at a location and the location in the direction the player wants to go is not blocked
   - effect: the player is at the new location and no longer at the old location
   - pddl: 
   ```
   (:action go
    :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)))
    :effect (and (at ?player ?loc2) (not (at ?player ?loc1)))
   )
   ```

Note: For each following action, I'll skip repeating the "parameters", "precondition", "effect" prompts, and instead integrate the information directly into the PDDL format for readability.

2. Action name: get
   ```
   (:action get
    :parameters (?player - player ?item - items)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (is_gettable ?item) (not (inventory ?player ?item)))
    :effect (and (inventory ?player ?item) (not (at ?item ?loc)))
   )
   ```
3. Action name: lay_masking_tape
   ```
   (:action lay_masking_tape
    :parameters (?tape - masking_tape)
    :precondition (is_gettable ?tape)
    :effect (has_ten_strips ?tape)
   )
   ```

4. Action name: make_tosses_column
   ```
   (:action make_tosses_column
    :parameters (?paper - paper ?pen - pen)
    :precondition (and (at ?paper ?loc) (at ?pen ?loc))
    :effect (tosses_column ?paper)
   )
   ```

5. Action name: make_crosses_column
   ```
   (:action make_crosses_column
    :parameters (?paper - paper ?pen - pen)
    :precondition (and (at ?paper ?loc) (at ?pen ?loc))
    :effect (crosses_column ?paper)
   )
   ```

6. Action name: thaw_food
   ```
   (:action thaw_food
    :parameters (?item - items)
    :precondition (and (is_gettable ?item) (is_food_item ?item) (frozen ?item))
    :effect (not (frozen ?item))
   )
   ```

7. Action name: throw
   ```
   (:action throw
    :parameters (?player - player ?item - items)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_throwing_distance ?item) (not (thrown_food_items ?loc)))
    :effect (thrown_food_items ?loc)
   )
   ```

8. Action name: record_tosses
   ```
   (:action record_tosses
    :parameters (?paper - paper)
    :precondition (tosses_column ?paper)
    :effect (tosses_recorded ?paper)
   )
   ```

9. Action name: record_crosses
   ```
   (:action record_crosses
    :parameters (?paper - paper)
    :precondition (and (tosses_recorded ?paper) (crosses_column ?paper))
    :effect (crosses_recorded ?paper)
   )
   ```

10. Action name: divide_crosses
    ```
    (:action divide_crosses
     :parameters (?paper - paper)
     :precondition (and (tosses_recorded ?paper) (crosses_recorded ?paper))
     :effect (crosses_divided ?paper)
    )
    ```

11. Action name: calculate_pi
    ```
    (:action calculate_pi
     :parameters (?player - player ?paper - paper)
     :precondition (and (crosses_divided ?paper) (not (calculated_pi ?player)))
     :effect (calculated_pi ?player)
    )
    ```

12. Action name: be_amazed
    ```
    (:action be_amazed
     :parameters (?player - player)
     :precondition (calculated_pi ?player)
     :effect (amazed ?player)
    )
    ```

Please note that you might need to adjust the parameters and the conditions in the preconditions and effects based on your actual planning problem. In this case, this is an illustrative example assuming certain relationships and dynamics between objects.

Alright. Let's create each action with parameters, preconditions and effects.

1. Action: `go`
   - parameters: a player, source location, destination location, and direction
   - precondition: the source and destination locations are connected in a specified direction and there is no blockage in that direction
   - effect: the player is no longer at the source location and now at the destination location
   - pddl: 
   ```
   (:action go
       :parameters (?p - player ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
       :precondition (and (at ?p ?from) (connected ?from ?dir ?to) (not (blocked ?from ?dir ?to)))
       :effect (and (not (at ?p ?from)) (at ?p ?to)))
   ```

2. Action: `get`
   - parameters: a player, an item, and the location
   - precondition: the player is at the location and the item is at the same location
   - effect: the item is no longer at the location and now in player's inventory
   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action get
       :parameters (?p - player ?i - item ?loc - location)
       :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?i ?loc))
       :effect (and (not (at ?i ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?i)))
   ```

3. Action: `get_water`
   - parameters: a player and a location
   - precondition: the location has a source of fresh water and the player is at the location
   - effect: the player has water in his/her inventory
   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action get_water
       :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
       :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_water_source ?loc))
       :effect (inventory ?p water))
   ```

4. Action: `strain_water`
   - parameters: a player and a cloth
   - precondition: the player has water and a cloth in his/her inventory

   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action strain_water
       :parameters (?p - player ?cl - cloth)
       :precondition (and (inventory ?p water) (inventory ?p ?cl))
       :effect (strained water))
   ```

5. Action: `boil_water`
   - parameters: a player and a container
   - precondition: the player has strained water and a container in his/her inventory and has started a fire
   - effect: the strained water in player's inventory has been treated by boiling
   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action boil_water
       :parameters (?p - player ?con - container)
       :precondition (and (inventory ?p water) (inventory ?p ?con) (has_fire ?p) (strained water))
       :effect (treated water))
   ```

6. Action: `purify_in_sunlight`
   - parameters: a player and a container
   - precondition: the player has strained water and a container in his/her inventory
   - effect: the strained water in player's inventory has been treated
   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action purify_in_sunlight
       :parameters (?p - player ?con - container)
       :precondition (and (inventory ?p water) (inventory ?p ?con) (strained water))
       :effect (treated water))
   ```

The other actions can be derived in a similar pattern. Please note that the actions were configured based on the predicates you provided and the usual principles of PDDL, and the specific meanings may need to be adjusted according to the specific game logic.
Sure, let's continue with the remaining actions:

7. Action: `get_long_branch`
   - parameters: a player and a location
   - precondition: the player is at the location which has branches
   - effect: The player has a long branch in his/her inventory
   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action get_long_branch
       :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
       :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_branches ?loc))
       :effect (inventory ?p long_branch))
   ```

8. Action: `get_propped_branches`
   - parameters: a player and a location
   - precondition: the player is at the location which has branches
   - effect: The player has propped_branches in his/her inventory
   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action get_propped_branches
       :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
       :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_branches ?loc))
       :effect (inventory ?p propped_branches))
   ```

   - pddl:
   ```
   (:action get_twigs_leaves
       :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
       :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_twigs_leaves ?loc))
       :effect (inventory ?p twigs_leaves))
   ```

10. Action: `build_shelter`
    - parameters: a player
    - precondition: The player has long_branch, propped_branches, and twigs_leaves in his/her inventory
    - effect: The player has built a shelter
    - pddl:
    ```
    (:action build_shelter
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (and (inventory ?p long_branch) (inventory ?p propped_branches) (inventory ?p twigs_leaves))
        :effect (has_shelter ?p))
    ```

11. Action: `get_logs`
    - parameters: a player and a location
    - precondition: The player is at the location which has logs
    - effect: The player has logs in his/her inventory
    - pddl:
    ```
    (:action get_logs
        :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
        :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_logs ?loc))
        :effect (inventory ?p logs))
    ```

12. Action: `get_dry_materials`
    - parameters: a player and a location
    - precondition: The player is at a location; for this action, we don't have a specific predicate so it can be considered at any location
    - effect: The player has dry materials in his/her inventory
    - pddl:
    ```
    (:action get_dry_materials
        :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location)
        :precondition (at ?p ?loc)
        :effect (inventory ?p dry_materials))
    ```

13. Action: `build_teepee`
    - parameters: a player
    - precondition: The player has logs in his/her inventory
    - effect: The player has a teepee; since we don't have a predicate for having a teepee in this context, let's consider it to be the same as having a shelter
    - pddl:
    ```
    (:action build_teepee
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (inventory ?p logs)
        :effect (has_shelter ?p))
    ```

14. Action: `start_fire`
    - parameters: a player
    - precondition: The player has dry materials and logs in his/her inventory and has built a shelter
    - effect: The player has started a fire
    - pddl:
    ```
    (:action start_fire
        :parameters (?p - player)
        :precondition (and (inventory ?p dry_materials) (inventory ?p logs) (has_shelter ?p))
        :effect (has_fire ?p))
    ```

This concludes all the actions.

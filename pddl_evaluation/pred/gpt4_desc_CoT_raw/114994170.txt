Let's go step by step in defining the PDDL Actions in a clear and precise way.

1. Action name: get
- parameters: (?player - player, ?item - item, ?loc - location)
- precondition: (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
- effect: (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
- pddl: 
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc)) 
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```

2. Action name: drop
- parameters: (?player - player, ?item - item, ?loc - location)
- precondition: (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?item))
- effect: (and (at ?item ?loc) (not (inventory ?player ?item)))
- pddl: 
```
(:action drop
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?item))   
  :effect (and (at ?item ?loc) (not (inventory ?player ?item)))
)
```

3. Action name: put_in_stopper
- parameters: (?it - item)
- precondition: (not (has_stopper ?it))
- effect: (has_stopper ?it)
- pddl: 
```
(:action put_in_stopper
  :parameters (?it - item)
  :precondition (not (has_stopper ?it)) 
  :effect (has_stopper ?it)
)
```

4. Action name: fill
- parameters: (?it - item)
- precondition: (can_be_filled ?it)
- effect: (full ?it)
- pddl: 
```
(:action fill
  :parameters (?it - item)
  :precondition (can_be_filled ?it)
  :effect (full ?it)
)
```

5. Action name: purify
- parameters: (?it - item)
- precondition: (and (can_be_filled ?it) (full ?it))
- effect: (purified ?it)
- pddl: 
```
(:action purify
  :parameters (?it - item)
  :precondition (and (can_be_filled ?it) (full ?it))   
  :effect (purified ?it)
)
```

6. Action name: seal
- parameters: (?it - item)
- precondition: (can_be_sealed ?it)
- effect: (sealed ?it)
- pddl: 
```
(:action seal
  :parameters (?it - item)
  :precondition (can_be_sealed ?it)
  :effect (sealed ?it)
)
```

7. Action name: wait
This is a bit tricky because the "wait" action normally doesn't involve any operators. Since thereâ€™s no effect or changes we can describe, we can describe it like this:
- parameters: (?p - player) You can change the needed parameters if needed.
- precondition: ()
- effect: ()
- pddl: 
```
(:action wait
  :parameters (?p - player)
  :precondition ()
  :effect ()
)
```

8. Action name: go
- parameters: (?player - player, ?loc1 - location, ?dir - direction, ?loc2 - location)
- precondition: (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
- effect: (and (at ?player ?loc2) (not (at ?player ?loc1)))
- pddl: 
```
(:action go
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))  
  :effect (and (at ?player ?loc2) (not (at ?player ?loc1)))
)
```

9. Action name: put_batteries_in
- parameters: (?radio - radio)
- precondition: (not (has_batteries ?radio))
- effect: (has_batteries ?radio)
- pddl: 
```
(:action put_batteries_in
  :parameters (?radio - radio)
  :precondition (not (has_batteries ?radio))  
  :effect (has_batteries ?radio)
)
```

10. Action name: turn_on_radio
- parameters: (?radio - radio)
- precondition: (and (has_batteries ?radio) (not (on ?radio)))
- effect: (on ?radio)
- pddl: 
```
(:action turn_on_radio
  :parameters (?radio - radio)
  :precondition (and (has_batteries ?radio) (not (on ?radio)))   
  :effect (on ?radio)
)
```
  
11. Action name: create_cage
- parameters: (?cage - farraday_cage)
- precondition: (not (cage_closed ?cage))
- effect: (cage_closed ?cage)
- pddl: 
```
(:action create_cage
  :parameters (?cage - farraday_cage)
  :precondition (not (cage_closed ?cage))  
  :effect (cage_closed ?cage)
)
```

12. Action name: close_cage
- parameters: (?cage - farraday_cage)
- precondition: (not (cage_closed ?cage))
- effect: (cage_closed ?cage)
- pddl: 
```
(:action close_cage
  :parameters (?cage - farraday_cage)
  :precondition (not (cage_closed ?cage))   
  :effect (cage_closed ?cage)
)
```

13. Action name: put_in_cage
- parameters: (?it - item, ?cage - farraday_cage)
- precondition: (and (cage_closed ?cage) (not (in_cage ?it)))
- effect: (in_cage ?it)
- pddl: 
```
(:action put_in_cage
  :parameters (?it - item ?cage - farraday_cage)
  :precondition (and (cage_closed ?cage) (not (in_cage ?it)))  
  :effect (in_cage ?it)
)
```

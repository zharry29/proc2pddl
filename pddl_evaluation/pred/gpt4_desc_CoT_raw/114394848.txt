Due to the complex nature of your request, I will only provide the first 3 actions now. Ready for the remainder upon request.

For each action, do the following:
1) List out the parameters – the objects that action works with.
2) Define the precondition – the requirements that need to be in place before the action can happen.
3) Define the effect – what will change because of the action. 

Let's start with the first three actions : "go", "understand" and "learn"

1. Action: go
- Parameters: ?player - player, ?to - location
- Precondition: (not (at ?player ?to)) means the player should not already be at the target location.
- Effect: (at ?player ?to) means the player is now at the target location.

PDDL:
```
(:action go
    :parameters (?player - player ?to - location)
    :precondition (not (at ?player ?to))
    :effect (at ?player ?to))
```

2. Action: understand
- Parameters: ?player - player, ?concept - concept
- Precondition: Not(know ?player ?concept) means player does not already understand the concept.
- Effect: Know(?player ?concept) means player now understands the concept.

PDDL:
```
(:action understand
    :parameters (?player - player ?concept - concept)
    :precondition (not(know ?player ?concept))
    :effect (know ?player ?concept))
```

3. Action: learn
- Parameters: ?player - player, ?skill - skill
- Precondition: Not(learned ?player ?skill) means player has not already learned the skill.
- Effect: Learned(?player ?skill) means player has now learned the skill.

PDDL:
```
(:action learn
    :parameters (?player - player ?skill - skill)
    :precondition (not(learned ?player ?skill))
    :effect (learned ?player ?skill))
```
Sure, let's keep going. We'll define the next three actions: "get", "machine_secured", and "enumeration".

4. Action: get
- Parameters: ?player - player, ?item - item

    :precondition (not (inventory ?player ?item))
    :effect (inventory ?player ?item))
```

5. Action: machine_secured
- Parameters: ?player - player

    :precondition (not (authorized ?player))
    :effect (authorized ?player))
```

6. Action: enumeration
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: Not(collected_all_info ?player) means the player hasn't collected all the necessary information yet.

PDDL:
```
(:action got_all_info
    :parameters (?player - player)
    :precondition (not (collected_all_info ?player))
    :effect (collected_all_info ?player))
```

8. Action: ping
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: Every action has some preconditions, but in this case, let's consider there's no specific precondition for the action "ping". Hence, precondition would be true.
- Effect: ping_succeed(?player) means now the ping action from player was successful.

PDDL:
```
(:action ping
    :parameters (?player - player)
    :precondition (true)
    :effect (ping_succeed ?player))
```

9. Action: check_email_server

    :precondition (not (server_checked ?player))
    :effect (server_checked ?player))
```

    :precondition (not (at ?player computer))
    :effect (at ?player computer)
)
```
11. Action: run_port_scan
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: Not(port_scanned ?player) means player hasn't already run a scan on port.

```

12. Action: found_path_in_system
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: (at ?player computer) and (port_scanned ?player) means player is at remote system and has done the port scanning.
- Effect: It doesn’t seem to have any effect to be written in PDDL without specific mapping to predicates. In general, after this action, the player should be aware of a viable path in the system. Assuming that we interpret this as having all necessary info, we can use collected_all_info predicate.

PDDL:
```
(:action found_path_in_system
    :parameters (?player - player)
    :precondition (and (at ?player computer) (port_scanned ?player))
    :effect (collected_all_info ?player)

PDDL:
```
(:action create_fake_wifi_access

)
```
Sure, let's continue with the next few actions: "crack_password_by_brute_force", "gain_access_with_password" and "create_buffer_overflow".

  :precondition (not (password_cracked ?player))
  :effect (password_cracked ?player)
)
```

20. Action: gain_access_with_password

  :effect (authorized ?player)
)
```

21. Action: create_buffer_overflow
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: is_root_user(?player) means the player is a root user.
- Effect: It doesn’t seem to have any effect to be written in PDDL by using existing predicates. Generally, after this action, the player should have created irregularity in memory to exploit the system. Assuming we don't have a specific predicate for this, we can use is_root_user again to indicate extensive system control.

PDDL:
```
(:action create_buffer_overflow
  :parameters (?player - player)
  :precondition (is_root_user ?player)
  :effect (is_root_user ?player)
)
```
Sure, let's continue with the next few actions: "take_control_of_system", "install_malware" and "bypass_standard_authentication_system".

22. Action: take_control_of_system
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: (and (is_root_user ?player) (authorized ?player)) means the player is a root user and also authorized.
- Effect: According to the action name and its context, I suppose ?, this action should lead to extended system control for the player, which could be expressed by the "is_root_user" predicate.

PDDL:
```
(:action take_control_of_system
  :parameters (?player - player)
  :precondition (and (is_root_user ?player) (authorized ?player))
  :effect (is_root_user ?player)
)
```

23. Action: install_malware
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: is_root_user(?player) means the player is a root user.
- Effect: This action should lead to some undesirable system state change. Since there is no predicate straightforwardly mapping to malware installation, we again use the "is_root_user" to express extended system control for the player.

PDDL:
```
(:action install_malware
  :parameters (?player - player)
  :precondition (is_root_user ?player)
  :effect (is_root_user ?player)
)
```

24. Action: bypass_standard_authentication_system
- Parameters: ?player - player
- Precondition: Not(authorized ?player) means the player is not yet authorized.
- Effect: authorized(?player) meaning the player is now authorized after bypassing the authentication system.

PDDL:
```
(:action bypass_standard_authentication_system
  :parameters (?player - player)
  :precondition (not (authorized ?player))
  :effect (authorized ?player)
)
```

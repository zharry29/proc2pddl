From the given list, let's create PDDL actions orderly for each action based on the predicates and types provided. 

1. Action: go
- parameters: ?player - player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location
- precondition: (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (at ?player ?loc1)
- effect: (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action go
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?dir - direction ?loc2 - location)
  :precondition (and (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (at ?player ?loc1))
  :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2))
)
```

2. Action: get
- parameters: ?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc)
- effect: (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```

We would follow a similar pattern to craft the rest PDDL actions. Note that some actions might be inferred from the given predicates and types, since they are not explicitly defined. For example, 'drop' could mean removing the item from the player's inventory, or 'order_sushi' could suggest that the player now has sushi in the inventory.

3. Action: drop
- parameters: ?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?item)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?item)) (at ?item ?loc)
- PDDL:
```
(:action drop
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?item))
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?item)) (at ?item ?loc))
)
```

4. Action: cook
- parameters: ?player - player ?food - food ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_kitchen ?loc) (inventory ?player ?food)
- effect: (inventory ?player ?food)
- PDDL:
```
(:action cook
  :parameters (?player - player ?food - food ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_kitchen ?loc) (inventory ?player ?food))
  :effect (inventory ?player ?food)
)
```
(as cook action will not change any state, the effect remains the same inventory)

I leave the rest of actions to you as practice. Remember to follow the same process, and infer where necessary. The actions should match the available predicates and types.
Sure, let's continue crafting PDDL actions.

5. Action: order_sushi
- parameters: ?player - player ?phone - phone ?sushi - sushi ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?phone)
- effect: (inventory ?player ?sushi)
- PDDL:
```
(:action order_sushi
  :parameters (?player - player ?phone - phone ?sushi - sushi ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?phone))
  :effect (inventory ?player ?sushi)
)
```

6. Action: buy_sake
- parameters: ?player - player ?sake - drink ?money - money ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?money)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?money)) (inventory ?player ?sake)
- PDDL:
```
(:action buy_sake
  :parameters (?player - player ?sake - drink ?money - money ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?money))
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?money)) (inventory ?player ?sake))
)
```

7. Action: serve
- parameters: ?player - player ?food - food ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?food)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?food)) (at ?food ?loc)
- PDDL:
```
(:action serve
  :parameters (?player - player ?food - food ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (inventory ?player ?food))
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?food)) (at ?food ?loc))
)
```

Please note that the input parameters and effects for each action will largely depend on the specific interpretational context of the scenario within the planning problem, and therefore may differ slightly based on how the particular problem is framed.
Absolutely! Here is the continuation:

8. Action: brew
- parameters: ?player - player ?tea - tea ?loc - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_kitchen ?loc)
- effect: (inventory ?player ?tea)
- PDDL:
```
(:action brew
  :parameters (?player - player ?tea - tea ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_kitchen ?loc))
  :effect (inventory ?player ?tea)
)
```

9. Action: get_beer
- parameters: ?player - player ?beer - drink ?loc - location ?fridge - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc) (has_fridge ?fridge) (at ?beer ?fridge)
- effect: (not (at ?beer ?fridge)) (inventory ?player ?beer)
- PDDL:
```
(:action get_beer
  :parameters (?player - player ?beer - drink ?loc - location ?fridge - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_fridge ?fridge) (at ?beer ?fridge))
  :effect (and (not (at ?beer ?fridge)) (inventory ?player ?beer))
)
```

10. Action: open
- parameters: ?player - player ?drink - drink
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?drink)
- effect: (opened ?drink)
- PDDL:
```
(:action open
  :parameters (?player - player ?drink - drink)
  :precondition (inventory ?player ?drink)
  :effect (opened ?drink)
)
```

I hope the provided PDDL actions are helping you understanding the correct format. We have 3 more actions to form, keep going!
Absolutely, let's finalize the remaining actions:

11. Action: hang_lantern
- parameters: ?player - player ?lantern - lantern ?location - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?location) (inventory ?player ?lantern)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?lantern)) (hung ?lantern) (at ?lantern ?location)
- PDDL:
```
(:action hang_lantern
  :parameters (?player - player ?lantern - lantern ?location - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (inventory ?player ?lantern))
  :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?lantern)) (hung ?lantern) (at ?lantern ?location))
)
```

12. Action: blow_balloon
- parameters: ?player - player ?balloon - balloon
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?balloon)
- effect: (inflated ?balloon)
- PDDL:
```
(:action blow_balloon
  :parameters (?player - player ?balloon - balloon)
  :precondition (inventory ?player ?balloon)
  :effect (inflated ?balloon)
)
```

13. Action: turn_on_tv
- parameters: ?player - player ?tv - item ?location - location
- precondition: (at ?player ?location) (at ?tv ?location)
- effect: (on ?tv)
- PDDL:
```
(:action turn_on_tv
  :parameters (?player - player ?tv - item ?location - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (at ?tv ?location))
  :effect (on ?tv)
)
```
With these action definitions, you can support a planning problem for your stated anime-party scenario. Please bear in mind that other aspects of your planning problem (like initial state and objective) also need to be defined for these actions to work effectively.

Alright! Let's go through each of your actions and define the parameters, the preconditions, and their effect.

For your first action, go:
- action name: go
- parameters: player, direction, initial_location, target_location
- precondition: `(at player initial_location)` and `(connected initial_location direction target_location)`
- effect: not `(at player initial_location)` and `(at player target_location)`
- pddl:
```
(:action go
   :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?initial_loc - location ?target_loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?initial_loc) (connected ?initial_loc ?dir ?target_loc))
   :effect (and (not (at ?player ?initial_loc)) (at ?player ?target_loc))
)
```

For the second action, get:
- action name: get
- parameters: player, an item, and a location
- precondition: `(at item location)` and `(at player location)`
- effect: not`(at item location)` and `(inventory player item)`
- pddl:
```
(:action get
   :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?item ?location) (at ?player ?location))
   :effect (and (not (at ?item ?location)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```

We follow this process for each action. I'll demonstrate the process one more time for the build_roof action:

- action name: build_roof
- parameters: player, a roof, log, and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and`(inventory player log)`
- effect: `(ensure roof)`, not `(inventory player log)`
- pddl:
```
(:action build_roof
   :parameters (?player - player ?roof - roof ?log - log ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (inventory ?player ?log))
   :effect (and (ensure ?roof) (not (inventory ?player ?log)))
)
```

Note: PDDL doesn't have an `ensure` effect; this is just an example. In your actual PDDL code, you'd replace `ensure` with whatever effect building a roof would have in your game's logic. Maybe the player gains the `has_roof` predicate or something similar.

You would follow the same process to define PDDL actions for build_wall, build_bed, complete_shelter, hunt_animal, prepare_animal, build_raft, and test_raft, using the actions and predicates you've defined. When defining these actions in PDDL, the key is to ensure that the action's preconditions are conditions that can be met in the game state, and that the effects cause meaningful changes in the game state.
Sure! Let's go on to define some more of your actions, following the same steps. 

For the action build_wall:
- action name: build_wall
- parameters: player, a wall, small_sticks, and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(inventory player small_sticks)`
- effect: `(ensure wall)`, not `(inventory player small_sticks)`
- pddl:
```
(:action build_wall
   :parameters (?player - player ?wall - wall ?small_sticks - small_sticks ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (inventory ?player ?small_sticks))
   :effect (and (ensure ?wall) (not (inventory ?player ?small_sticks)))
)
```

For the action build_bed:
- action name: build_bed
- parameters: player, a bed, leaves, and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(inventory player leaves)`
- effect: `(ensure bed)`, not `(inventory player leaves)`
- pddl:
```
(:action build_bed
   :parameters (?player - player ?bed - bed ?leaves - leaves ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (inventory ?player ?leaves))
   :effect (and (ensure ?bed) (not (inventory ?player ?leaves)))
)
```

For the action complete_shelter (assuming roof, wall, and bed completes a shelter):
- action name: complete_shelter
- parameters: player, a shelter, a roof, a wall, a bed, and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(has roof)` and `(has wall)` and `(has bed)`
- effect: `(ensure shelter)`
- pddl:
```
(:action complete_shelter
   :parameters (?player - player ?shelter - shelter ?roof - roof ?wall - wall ?bed - bed ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (has ?roof) (has ?wall) (has ?bed))
   :effect (ensure ?shelter)
)
```
I've used "ensure" again here, please replace it with the actual action from your game logic.

You can continue this process to define the other actions: hunt_animal, prepare_animal, build_raft, and test_raft. Ensure that the preconditions of the actions can be met in the game state and the effects cause significant changes in the game state.
Certainly, let's continue for the rest of the actions.

For the action hunt_animal:
- action name: hunt_animal
- parameters: player, a sharp_stone, an animal, and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(at animal location)` and `(inventory player sharp_stone)`
- effect: `treated animal` and  not `(at animal location)`
- pddl:
```
(:action hunt_animal
   :parameters (?player - player ?stone - sharp_stone ?animal - animal ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (at ?animal ?location) (inventory ?player ?stone))
   :effect (and (treated ?animal) (not (at ?animal ?location)))
)
```

For the action prepare_animal:
- action name: prepare_animal
- parameters: player, a sharp_stone, a treated_animal and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(treated treated_animal)` and `(inventory player sharp_stone)`
- effect: not `(treated treated_animal)` (because it is prepared)
- pddl:
```
(:action prepare_animal
   :parameters (?player - player ?stone - sharp_stone ?treated_animal - animal ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (treated ?treated_animal) (inventory ?player ?stone))
   :effect (not (treated ?treated_animal))
)
```

For the action build_raft:
- action name: build_raft
- parameters: player, a raft_draft and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(inventory player raft_draft)`
- effect: `(ensure raft_finished)` not `(inventory player raft_draft)`
- pddl:
```
(:action build_raft
   :parameters (?player - player ?raft_draft - raft_draft ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (inventory ?player ?raft_draft))
   :effect (and (ensure ?raft_finished) (not (inventory ?player ?raft_draft)))
)
```

Lastly for the action test_raft:
- action name: test_raft
- parameters: player, a raft_finished and location
- precondition: `(at player location)` and `(ensure raft_finished)`
- effect: (Here we just assume the test is only for the player to confirm the raft is usable - so no change)
- pddl:
```
(:action test_raft
   :parameters (?player - player ?raft_finished - raft_finished ?location - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?player ?location) (ensure ?raft_finished))
   :effect ()
)
```

Please replace ensure with the correct verb depending on what it should do in your application. This finish up all the actions following the format you specified. Always make sure to check the preconditions, and that the effects are changing the state meaningfully.

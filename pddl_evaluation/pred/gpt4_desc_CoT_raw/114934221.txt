Given the predicate definitions, types and requirements provided, each action could be defined with Parameters, Precondition, and Effect. Here, I will illustrate this one by one.

Here is how you can implement each PDDL action:

1. Action name: splash_swim
- parameters: (?player - player ?loc - location)
- precondition: (and (at ?player ?loc) (is_water ?loc))
- effect: (fleed ?shark)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action splash_swim
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc)  (is_water ?loc))
  :effect (fleed ?shark)
)
```

2. action name: swim
- parameters: (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
- precondition: (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (is_water ?loc2))
- effect: (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2))
- PDDL: 
```
(:action swim
  :parameters (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (is_water ?loc2))
  :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2))
)
```

3. action name: get
- parameters: (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
- precondition: (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
- effect: (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
- PDDL: 
```
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```

4. action name: onboard
- parameters: (?player - player ?ship - ship)
- precondition: (visible ?ship)
- effect: (on ?player ?ship)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action onboard
  :parameters (?player - player ?ship - ship)
  :precondition (visible ?ship)
  :effect (on ?player ?ship)
)
```

5. Action name: defend
- parameters: (?player - player)
- precondition: (wounded ?player)
- effect: (defending ?player)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action defend
  :parameters (?player - player)
  :precondition (wounded ?player)
  :effect (defending ?player)
)
```

Please note that you need to fix the `knockout` and `attack_vulnerable` because you wrote the same description for both. Likewise, it's unclear what object the `spot_ship` and `spot_shark` actions are supposed to be attached to. You must clearly define what role a shark, ship, or player performs in these actions. 

Moreover, the predicate `dizzy` is provided, but it's not used in any of the actions, leading to inconsistency. 

Consequently, you may need to revisit these actions to provide more detailed descriptions or perhaps alter your predicates. I hope this is helpful!
Apologies for the confusion for previous 5 actions, but let's keep moving:

6. Action name: spot_ship
- parameters: (?player - player ?ship - ship)
- precondition: (at ?ship ?loc)
- effect: (visible ?ship)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action spot_ship
  :parameters (?player - player ?ship - ship)
  :precondition (at ?ship ?loc)
  :effect (visible ?ship)
)
```

7. Action name: spot_shark
- parameters: (?player - player ?shark - shark)
- precondition: (at ?shark ?loc)
- effect: (visible ?shark)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action spot_shark
  :parameters (?player - player ?shark - shark)
  :precondition (at ?shark ?loc)
  :effect (visible ?shark)
)
```

8. Action name: self_mobilize
- parameters: (?player - player ?shark - shark)
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc)
- effect: (defending ?player)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action self_mobilize
  :parameters (?player - player ?shark - shark)
  :precondition (at ?player ?loc)
  :effect (defending ?player)
)
```

9. Action name: medicare
- parameters: (?player - player)
- precondition: (wounded ?player)
- effect: (not (wounded ?player))
- PDDL: 
```
(:action medicare
  :parameters (?player - player)
  :precondition (wounded ?player)
  :effect (not (wounded ?player))
)
```

10. Action name: attack_vulnerable
- parameters: (?player - player ?shark - shark ?part - part ?obj - object)
- precondition: (and (vulnerable ?part) (sharp ?obj) (inventory ?player ?obj))
- effect: (dizzy ?shark)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action attack_vulnerable
  :parameters (?player - player ?shark - shark ?part - part ?obj - object)
  :precondition (and (vulnerable ?part) (sharp ?obj) (inventory ?player ?obj))
  :effect (dizzy ?shark)
)
```

11. Action name: knockout
- parameters: (?player - player ?shark - shark ?part - part ?obj - object)
- precondition: (and (vulnerable ?part) (heavy ?obj) (inventory ?player ?obj))
- effect: (dizzy ?shark)
- PDDL: 
```
(:action knockout
  :parameters (?player - player ?shark - shark ?part - part ?obj - object)
  :precondition (and (vulnerable ?part) (heavy ?obj) (inventory ?player ?obj))
  :effect (dizzy ?shark)
)
```
In this way, each action is properly described and configured. Ensure you have a solid understanding of your problem space and how each action interacts with the world and the player.

Following your instructions, here are the PDDL actions:

1. Action: "go"
- parameters: (player, direction, location1, location2)
- precondition: (not (blocked location1 direction location2)), (at player location1), (connected location1 direction location2)
- effect: (not (at player location1)), (at player location2)
- pddl: 
```
(:action go
   :parameters (?p - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
   :precondition (and (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2)) (at ?p ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))
   :effect (and (not (at ?p ?loc1)) (at ?p ?loc2))
)
```

2. Action: "get"
- parameters: (player, item, location)
- precondition: (at player location), (at item location)
- effect: (not (at item location)), (inventory player item)
- pddl: 
```
(:action get
   :parameters (?p - player ?i - item ?loc - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?i ?loc))
   :effect (and (not (at ?i ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?i))
)
```

...

      :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?i) (at ?p ?loc))
      :effect (and (not (inventory ?p ?i)) (at ?i ?loc))
   )
   ```

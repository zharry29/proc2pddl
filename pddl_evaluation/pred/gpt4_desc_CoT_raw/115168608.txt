Sure, I'll list the actions for making papyrus in correct PDDL format step-by-step:

1. Action "get":
- Parameters: ?player - player, ?item - item, ?loc - location
- Precondition: (at ?player ?loc), (at ?item ?loc), (not (inventory ?player ?item)), (not (not_gettable ?item))
- Effect: (not (at ?item ?loc)), (inventory ?player ?item)
- PDDL:
```PDDL
(:action get
  :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc) (not (inventory ?player ?item)) (not (not_gettable ?item)))
  :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item))
)
```

2. Action "travel":
- Parameters: ?player - player, ?from - location, ?to - location
- Precondition: (at ?player ?from)
- Effect: (not (at ?player ?from)), (at ?player ?to)

Let's start creating the PDDL for all the actions based on the given predicates. Please note that some information might be missing which could influence the correctness of the PDDL. 

- action name: go
- parameters: ?player - player ?dir - direction ?destination - location
- precondition: (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?destination)) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?destination)
- effect: (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?destination) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action go
      :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?destination - location)
      :precondition (and
          (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?destination))
          (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?destination)
          (at ?player ?loc1)
      )
      :effect (and
          (not (at ?player ?loc1))
          (at ?player ?destination)
      )
  )
  ```

Similarly, you will need to fill in the values for other actions. Let's fill out the `get` action for demonstration as well.

- action name: get
- parameters: ?item - item ?player - player 
- precondition: (at ?item ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1)
- effect: (not (at ?item ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?item) 
- pddl:

 ```
  (:action get
      :parameters (?item - item ?player - player)
      :precondition (and
          (at ?item ?loc1)
          (at ?player ?loc1)
      )
      :effect (and
          (not (at ?item ?loc1))
          (inventory ?player ?item)
      )
  )
  ```

For other actions like `get_grass`, `dry_grass`, etc, you can follow the same approach. You need to provide appropriate parameters, predicates for preconditions and effects. The parameters will depend on what the action requires, and predicates for preconditions and effects will depend on what conditions should be valid before the action happens and what should be caused by the action. 

Make sure to respect the types and predicates given and if something is unclear, you might have to make reasonable assumptions.
Sure, let's continue with the actions.

- action name: get_grass
- parameters:  ?player - player ?grass - grass
- precondition: (at ?grass ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1) (not(dry ?grass))
- effect: (not (at ?grass ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?grass)
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action get_grass
      :parameters (?player - player ?grass - grass)
      :precondition (and
          (at ?grass ?loc1)
          (at ?player ?loc1)
          (not (dry ?grass))
      )
      :effect (and
          (not (at ?grass ?loc1))
          (inventory ?player ?grass)
      )
  )
  ```

Let's continue with the "dry_grass" action.

- action name: dry_grass
- parameters:  ?player - player ?grass - grass
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?grass) (not (dry ?grass))
- effect: (dry ?grass)
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action dry_grass
      :parameters (?player - player ?grass - grass)
      :precondition (and
          (inventory ?player ?grass)
          (not (dry ?grass))
      )
      :effect (and
          (dry ?grass)
      )
  )
  ```

Please note that in actions like `get_grass` and `dry_grass`, we are making an assumption that the grass is in the player's inventory. The actual actions may vary depending on the indirect or direct approach taken in the game. 

You can continue the process with the other actions by selecting the appropriate parameters and filling in the preconditions and effects according to their functionality in survival.
Sure, let's carry on with the next actions.

- action name: cluster_grass
- parameters: ?player - player ?tinder - tinder
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?grass) (dry ?grass)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?grass)) (inventory ?player ?tinder) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action cluster_grass
    :parameters (?player - player ?tinder - tinder)
    :precondition (and
        (inventory ?player ?grass)
        (dry ?grass)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (inventory ?player ?grass))
        (inventory ?player ?tinder)
    )
)
```

Now let's move on to the "break_branch" action.

- action name: break_branch
- parameters:  ?player - player ?branch - branch
- precondition: (at ?branch ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1) (has_large_dry_branch ?loc1)
- effect: (not (at ?branch ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?branch)
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action break_branch
      :parameters (?player - player ?branch - branch)
      :precondition (and
          (at ?branch ?loc1)
          (at ?player ?loc1)
          (has_large_dry_branch ?loc1)
      )
      :effect (and
          (not (at ?branch ?loc1))
          (inventory ?player ?branch)
      )
  )
  ```

In the above actions, we have assumed that, by clustering grass, you form tinder. In the `break_branch` action, you collect a branch from a location having large dry branches. Adjust these actions to match the rules of your game if needed. Then, just follow the same structure for the rest of the actions using the given preconditions and effects that match your game's rule set.
Certainly, let's proceed with the next actions.

- action name: log_oak
- parameters: ?player - player ?log - log
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc1) (has_dry_oak ?loc1)
- effect: (not (has_dry_oak ?loc1)) (at ?log ?loc1) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action log_oak
    :parameters (?player - player ?log - log)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?player ?loc1)
        (has_dry_oak ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (has_dry_oak ?loc1))
        (at ?log ?loc1)
    )
  )
  ```

Now, let's move forward to the "get_log" action.

- action name: get_log
- parameters: ?player - player ?log - log
- precondition: (at ?log ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1) 
- effect: (not (at ?log ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?log) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action get_log
    :parameters (?player - player ?log - log)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?log ?loc1)
        (at ?player ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (at ?log ?loc1))
        (inventory ?player ?log)
    )
  )
  ```

In the above actions, "log_oak" assumes the player is logging an oak tree at the location and "get_log" assumes that the player collects the log from the location. Please amend these actions to suit the logic of your game. Continue with the remaining actions using the same structure, employing the relevant preconditions and effects that fit your game's rule system.
Absolutely, let's advance with the subsequent actions.

- action name: stack_log
- parameters: ?player - player ?fuel - fuel
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?log) (dry ?log)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?log)) (inventory ?player ?fuel) 
- pddl:

 ```
  (:action stack_log
    :parameters (?player - player ?fuel - fuel)
    :precondition (and
        (inventory ?player ?log)
        (dry ?log)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (inventory ?player ?log))
        (inventory ?player ?fuel)
    )
  )
  ```

Now let's move on to the "build_teepee" action.

- action name: build_teepee
- parameters: ?player - player ?teepee - teepee
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?tinder) (inventory ?player ?fuel) (has_dry_even_area ?loc1)
- effect: (not (inventory ?player ?tinder)) (not (inventory ?player ?fuel)) (at ?teepee ?loc1)
- pddl:

 ```
  (:action build_teepee
    :parameters (?player - player ?teepee - teepee)
    :precondition (and
        (inventory ?player ?tinder)
        (inventory ?player ?fuel)
        (has_dry_even_area ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (inventory ?player ?tinder))
        (not (inventory ?player ?fuel))
        (at ?teepee ?loc1)
    )
  )
  ```

In the above actions, "stack_log" assumes that the player stacks the dry logs to make fuel in the inventory. "build_teepee" assumes that the player is building a teepee with collected fuel and tinder at a location with a dry, even area. The actual process may contain more intermediate steps. You can adjust these actions to match the rules of your game. However, the structure remains the same for the all actions, with the appropriate parameters, preconditions, and effects.
Sure, let's advance with the subsequent actions.

- action name: get_wood
- parameters: ?player - player ?wood - wood
- precondition: (at ?wood ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1)
- effect: (not (at ?wood ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?wood) 
- pddl:

 ```
  (:action get_wood
    :parameters (?player - player ?wood - wood)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?wood ?loc1)
        (at ?player ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (at ?wood ?loc1))
        (inventory ?player ?wood)
    )
  )
  ```

Now, let's move on to the "get_branch" action.

- action name: get_branch
- parameters: ?player - player ?branch - branch
- precondition: (at ?branch ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1) 
- effect: (not (at ?branch ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?branch) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action get_branch
    :parameters (?player - player ?branch - branch)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?branch ?loc1)
        (at ?player ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (at ?branch ?loc1))
        (inventory ?player ?branch)
    )
  )
  ```

In the above actions, "get_wood" assumes that the player gets a flat piece of solid wood from the location whereas "get_branch" assumes that the player gathers a solid branch from the location. Modify these actions as needed to correspond to the rules of your game. You can carry on with the rest of the actions using the same format and selecting the corresponding preconditions and effects.
Of course, let's proceed with the next actions.

- action name: ignite_wood
- parameters: ?player - player ?wood - wood
- precondition: (inventory ?player ?wood) (dry ?wood)
- effect: (ignited ?wood)
- pddl:

 ```
  (:action ignite_wood
    :parameters (?player - player ?wood - wood)
    :precondition (and
        (inventory ?player ?wood)
        (dry ?wood)
    )
    :effect (and
         (ignited ?wood)
    )
  )
  ```

Now let's deal with the "ignite_teepee" action.

- action name: ignite_teepee
- parameters: ?player - player ?teepee - teepee ?wood - wood
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc1) (at ?teepee ?loc1) (ignited ?wood)
- effect: (ignited ?teepee) 
- pddl:

 ```
  (:action ignite_teepee
    :parameters (?player - player ?teepee - teepee ?wood - wood)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?player ?loc1)
        (at ?teepee ?loc1)
        (ignited ?wood)
    )
    :effect (and
         (ignited ?teepee)
    )
  )
  ```

In the above actions, "ignite_wood" assumes that the player ignites the wood in their inventory, whereas "ignite_teepee" assumes that the player ignites the teepee at the same location using the ignited wood. Edit these actions as required in accordance with the rules of the game. Continue with the remainder of the actions, following the same approach and defining suitable preconditions and effects.
Absolutely, let's continue with the remaining actions.

- action name: get_pot
- parameters: ?player - player ?pot - pot
- precondition: (at ?pot ?loc1) (at ?player ?loc1)
- effect: (not (at ?pot ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?pot) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action get_pot
    :parameters (?player - player ?pot - pot)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?pot ?loc1)
        (at ?player ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
        (not (at ?pot ?loc1))
        (inventory ?player ?pot)
    )
  )
  ```

Now, let's move on to the "get_water" action.

- action name: get_water
- parameters: ?player - player ?water - water
- precondition: (at ?player ?loc1) (has_pond ?loc1) (inventory ?player ?pot)
- effect: (not (has_pond ?loc1)) (inventory ?player ?water) 
- pddl:

  ```
  (:action get_water
      :parameters (?player - player ?water - water)
      :precondition (and
          (at ?player ?loc1)
          (has_pond ?loc1)
          (inventory ?player ?pot)
      )
      :effect (and
          (not (has_pond ?loc1))
          (inventory ?player ?water)
      )
  )
  ```

In the above actions, "get_pot" indicates that the player retrieves a pot from the location whereas "get_water" indicates that the player retrieves water from a pond at a location using the retrieved pot. Adjust these actions as needed to correspond to the rules of your game. Continue with the final action using the same format, and selecting the relevant preconditions and effects.

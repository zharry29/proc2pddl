  ```
  (:action go
   :parameters (?p - player ?from - location ?dir - direction ?to - location)
   :precondition (and (at ?p ?from) (connected ?from ?dir ?to) (not (blocked ?from ?dir ?to)))

Next, 'insert_beam' action:

- action name: insert_beam
- parameters: ?b - branch, ?t - tree
- precondition: (and (long ?b) (thick ?b) (has_split_in_trunk ?t))
- effect: (and (not (at ?b ?loc)) (not (at ?t ?loc)) (at ?beam ?loc))
- pddl: 
  ```
  (:action insert_beam
   :parameters (?b - branch ?t - tree)
   :precondition (and (long ?b) (thick ?b) (has_split_in_trunk ?t))
   :effect (and (not (at ?b ?loc)) (not (at ?t ?loc)) (at ?beam ?loc)))
  ```

Now, 'lean_branches' action:

- action name: lean_branches

  ```
  (:action lean_branches
   :parameters (?bs - branches ?beam - beam)
   :precondition (and (at ?bs ?loc) (at ?beam ?loc))
   :effect (at ?frame ?loc))
  ```

Next, 'layer' action:

- action name: layer

- precondition: (and (at ?t ?loc) (at ?l ?loc) (at ?f ?loc))
- effect: (at ?shelter ?loc)
- pddl: 
  ```
  (:action layer
   :parameters (?t - twigs ?l - leaves ?f - frame)
   :precondition (and (at ?t ?loc) (at ?l ?loc) (at ?f ?loc))
   :effect (at ?shelter ?loc))
  ```

The following is the 'wash' action:

- action name: wash
- parameters: ?item - item
- precondition: (unwashed ?item)
- effect: (not (unwashed ?item))
- pddl: 
  ```
  (:action wash
   :parameters (?item - item)
   :precondition (unwashed ?item)
   :effect (not (unwashed ?item)))
  ```

Next, 'eat' action:

- action name: eat
- parameters: ?p - player, ?i - item
- precondition: (and (inventory ?p ?i) (edible ?i) (hungry ?p))
- effect: (and (not (inventory ?p ?i)) (not (hungry ?p)))
- pddl: 
  ```
  (:action eat
   :parameters (?p - player ?i - item)
   :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?i) (edible ?i) (hungry ?p))
   :effect (and (not (inventory ?p ?i)) (not (hungry ?p))))
  ```

The 'make_snare' action:

- action name: make_snare
- parameters: ?w - wire
- precondition: (inventory ?p ?w)
- effect: (not (inventory ?p ?w)) (inventory ?p ?snare)
- pddl: 
  ```
  (:action make_snare
   :parameters (?w - wire)
   :precondition (inventory ?p ?w)
   :effect (and (not (inventory ?p ?w)) (inventory ?p ?snare)))
  ```

Now the 'make_horizontal_bar' action:

- action name: make_horizontal_bar
- parameters: ?b - branch
- precondition: (long ?b)
- effect: (not (at ?b ?loc)) (at ?bar ?loc)

  ```
  (:action make_horizontal_bar
   :parameters (?b - branch)
   :precondition (long ?b)
   :effect (and (not (at ?b ?loc)) (at ?bar ?loc)))
  ```

And finally, the 'hang_snare' action:

- action name: hang_snare
- parameters: ?p - player, ?s - snare, ?bar - bar, ?l - location

- what is the result: The secret society is a cult.

- entities:
  - entity name: secret_society
    - before: The secret society has N players.
    - after: The secret society is a cult.

- describe how to match it to PDDL relevant predicates step by step:
This action should be based on the number of players (N) in the secret society. As checking the exact number of players in PDDL is not feasible, you could use a different method to achieve this in your problem formulation. For example, you could use a threshold and adjust it based on your problem, or you could use a different planning language that supports numeric fluents, like PDDL 3.0.

Please adjust the problem according to your constraints, and feel free to ask for further guidance if needed.
I understand that you would like to continue with the check_if_cult action. However, in PDDL, it's difficult to check the exact number of members directly. As an alternative, I am providing an example of how you can use a "threshold" mechanism to check if a secret society is a cult:

First, add a predicate and a new type called `counter` in your type and predicates definition:

```
(:types
    player secret_society counter
)

(:predicates
    ...
    (counter_value ?c - counter ?n - int)
    (cult_threshold ?t - int)
)
```

You will need to define a counter object and a threshold in the problem definition:

```
(:objects
    counter_1 - counter
    ...
)

(:init
    (counter_value counter_1 0)
    (cult_threshold 5) 
    ...
)
```

Next, you need to modify the `initiate_new_member` action to increment the counter whenever a new member is added:

```
(:action initiate_new_member
 :parameters (?p - player ?sc - secret_society ?c - counter ?n - int ?n_plus_one - int)
 :precondition (and (society_is_ready ?sc) (is_trusted ?p ?sc) 
                     (counter_value ?c ?n) (succ ?n ?n_plus_one))
 :effect (and (in ?p ?sc) (not (counter_value ?c ?n)) (counter_value ?c ?n_plus_one))
)
```

Finally, the `check_if_cult` action checks if the counter exceeds the threshold, and if it does, the society is considered a cult:

```
(:action check_if_cult
 :parameters (?sc - secret_society ?c - counter ?n - int ?t - int)
 :precondition (and (counter_value ?c ?n) (cult_threshold ?t)
                     (>= ?n ?t))
 :effect (is_cult ?sc)
)
```

This approach is not a direct way to check the number of members in the society but provides a workaround that allows you to consider the secret society as a cult when a certain threshold is met. You can adjust the `cult_threshold` in the problem definition according to your desired group size.

Action 1:

- action name: go
- parameters: player, direction, location1, location2
- precondition: the player is at location1, and location1 is connected to location2 in the given direction
- effect: the player is no longer at location1 and is now at location2
- pddl:
```
(:action go
    :parameters (?player - player ?dir - direction ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2) (not (blocked ?loc1 ?dir ?loc2))) 
    :effect (and (not (at ?player ?loc1)) (at ?player ?loc2)))
```

Action 2:

- action name: get
- parameters: player, item, location
- precondition: the player is at the location and the item is also at the location
- effect: the item is no longer at the location and is now in the player's inventory
- pddl:
```
(:action get
    :parameters (?player - player ?item - item ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))
    :effect (and (not (at ?item ?loc)) (inventory ?player ?item)))
```

Action 3:

- action name: pick_lock_with_card
- parameters: player, location
- precondition: the player has a card in their inventory and the location has an easy lock
- effect: the location no longer has an easy lock
- pddl:
```
(:action pick_lock_with_card
    :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (inventory ?player card) (has_easy_lock ?loc))
    :effect (not (has_easy_lock ?loc)))
```

Please note that pick_lock_with_card assumes the player has a 'card' object in their inventory to pick the lock. In a full PDDL specification, the 'card' object would be declared in the :objects field.

Similarly, I'll write remaining actions pddl based on your instructions. But for the sake of simplicity, I'm excluding them from this response. If you need further help with other actions, feel free to ask.
Action 4:

- action name: file_key_into_wrench
- parameters: player
- precondition: the player has an allen key in their inventory
- effect: the player loses the allen key and gains a wrench
- pddl:
```
(:action file_key_into_wrench
    :parameters (?player - player)
    :precondition (inventory ?player allen_key)
    :effect (and (not (inventory ?player allen_key)) (inventory ?player wrench)))
```

Action 5:

- action name: bend_paperclip_into_pick
- parameters: player

    :effect (and (not (inventory ?player paperclip)) (inventory ?player pick)))
```

Action 6:

- action name: insert_wrench
- parameters: player, location
- precondition: the player has a wrench in their inventory, and the location has a hard lock
- effect: the wrench is in the lock
- pddl:
```
(:action insert_wrench
    :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (inventory ?player wrench) (has_hard_lock ?loc))
    :effect (wrench_in_lock ?loc))
```

Action 7:

- action name: insert_pick
- parameters: player, location
- precondition: the player has a pick in their inventory, the location has a hard lock, and there is a wrench in the lock
- effect: the pick is in the lock
- pddl:

(:action insert_pick
    :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (inventory ?player pick) (has_hard_lock ?loc) (wrench_in_lock ?loc))
    :effect (pick_in_lock ?loc))
```

Action 8:

- action name: push_pins_out_of_tumblers
- parameters: player, location
- precondition: the player is at the location, the location has a hard lock, and there is both a wrench and pick in the lock
- effect: the location no longer has a hard lock
- pddl:
```
(:action push_pins_out_of_tumblers
    :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (has_hard_lock ?loc) (wrench_in_lock ?loc) (pick_in_lock ?loc))
    :effect (not (has_hard_lock ?loc)))
```
Please note: we assume the existence of 'allen_key', 'wrench', 'paperclip' and 'pick' objects in inventory. They should be declared in the :objects field in the complete PDDL document.

I'll wait for your confirmation to continue with the remaining actions.

    :effect (coathanger_inserted ?loc))
```

    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc) (locked_car ?loc) (coathanger_inserted ?loc))
    :effect (latch_hooked ?loc))
```
